## How to Create Stunning IG Stories to Captivate Your Audience?

You might already know how popular Instagram Stories have become in just a few years. The feature is used by over 500 million people and can be an excellent tool to reach out to your audience. Apart from learning how to put music on IG story, there are several other things that you can also do to make your stories more captivating and eye-catching.

#### Consider posting boomerangs and layouts

Boomerangs are extremely popular in Instagram stories due to their quick yet interesting visual appeal. It will make a small clip play in reverse and back a few times, focusing on the movement. You can just go to your Instagram Story interface and swipe the bottom slider to use your camera to record a boomerang. Apart from that, you can also play with different layouts here to post multiple pictures as a single story.

#### Add polls, challenges, countdowns, and more

Apart from adding music, Instagram also lets us add tons of other things to our story. You can mention any other user in your story or add a location to get more views. There are also options to add a hashtag or create a poll. You can also find different challenges to explore (like the ice bucket challenge) to post your story under a specific category.
