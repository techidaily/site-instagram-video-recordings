## Part 2: How to Add Music to Instagram without Music Stickers?

Instagram music works in most cases, but it may be useless if you do not find music of your choice. Sometimes, you want to add a specific song to go with the video's vibe or a photo. In that case, you can upload music using other methods as well. Here, we will share four ways to put music to Instagram stories without stickers.

### **Method 1: Add music** **to Instagram through Spotify Music**
