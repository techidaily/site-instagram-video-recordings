## Part 1: Instagram influencer definition

Before we start about working as an Instagram influencer, let’s understand what does [Instagram influencer mean](https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-instagram-influencer)? Influencers are content creators on Instagram who also build communities across a particular niche or topic. Being a visually rich platform you always need the most visually dynamic content for better performance.

These content creators/influencers usually focus on photography, travel, beauty, fashion, food, fitness, lifestyle, or celebrities sharing their personal lives on Instagram. Their fan following ranges from 1000 to millions. Content creators with 1000 to 100,000 and beyond followers are known as micro-influencers.
