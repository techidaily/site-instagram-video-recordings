## Top Ten IGTV Channels You Should Start Following in 2021

The quality of the content, the number of followers, as well as the amount and the frequency of new posts, should help you detect the Instagram accounts that are worth following. Furthermore, which IGTV channels you are going to follow depends largely on your area of interests, since there isn’t much sense in following someone whose content you have no intention of watching.

#### 1. Chiara Ferragni

16 million followers speak volumes about the popularity of this Italian fashion blogger.

#### 10. Justine Ezarik

Justine created her YouTube channel in 2006, and over the course of the last thirteen years, she has positioned herself as one of the most influential YouTubers ever.
