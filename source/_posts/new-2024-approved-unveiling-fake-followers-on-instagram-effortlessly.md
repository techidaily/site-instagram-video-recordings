 Such fake profiles are easily identifiable as they have very little followers and do not have any profile image or any other photos. But, there are a few who use genuine information of other real users, without their knowledge to prove themselves legitimate.

## Part 3: How to Check Fake Instagram Followers

### 1\. Check Followers

 While searching for a brand influencer and targeting a few, [go through the profile of each influencer](https://www.jeffbullas.com/how-to-check-if-an-influencer-is-influential/) to check if they have any fake followers in their profile. It is not very difficult to understand if the influencer you are targeting has fake followers or not. Wondering how? Check out for the points below to figure out the fake Instagram followers.

* Profiles with no photos must be considered fake. The brands must be cautious if the influencer they have targeted consist of fake followers who usually lack a profile picture in their accounts. Any sort of spammy usernames must also be considered fake.

### 3\. Check Engagement

 The [engagement rate](https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/) must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account. The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.

 The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10\. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.
