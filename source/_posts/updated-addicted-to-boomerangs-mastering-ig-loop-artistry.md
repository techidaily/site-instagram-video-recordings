Boomerangs are perfect when you add on a loop. This includes a forward movement, followed by a backward movement, and then forward again.

#### 3.Boomerang Selfies

You could move your hair, wink, smile, or play with your jacket. These are all effects that capture this app very well. It would certainly help make your selfies or profile pics special.
