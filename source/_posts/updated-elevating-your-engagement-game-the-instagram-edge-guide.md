![ins ads type](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-ads-type.JPG)

**Photo Ads**

Your product’s image is showcased here and piques the interest of the viewer to know more. It is almost same as a picture as a post on your Instagram account.

**Stories Ads**

These Ads are part of your Instagram Stories. You can feature the product or service video/photo on your Instagram Stories that people can see as a story.

**Video Ads**

You can upload your product video as an Ad. When people are going through numerous feeds on Instagram, your Ad appears and if it interests them, they might click it to land on your business page.

**Carousel Ads**

Carousel Ads are like a photo album that collaborates multiple products and services at one place. Instagram users can scroll through them and then get in touch with you.

**Slideshow Ads**

Slideshow Ads on Instagram are slideshows combining multiple services and videos.

### How to post ads from Instagram?

Prior to starting your Instagram promotion, make sure that the following things are taken care of –

* Create a business profile on Instagram.
* You got to be the admin of the Facebook page, through which you operate your Instagram account. Request the admin to add you as one, in case you are not the admin of that page.

### Steps to promote your post

Here is a step-by-step guide to promote your Instagram post –

* Visit your Instagram account and click on the post you intend to promote.
* Click on ‘Promote’ right under the post’s image and key in the details about it.

**Note**: Who will be your audience, how much budget you have fixed, how long you intend to run the promotion etc. are filled mandatorily.

* Now, click ‘Next’ and then hit ‘Promote’ again to start the promotion.
* After this, the Instagram promotion is reviewed in about an hour or longer. Once it meets the Ad policies of Instagram, it gets approval and can run on Instagram.

### 1\. Find Influencers first

Use hashtags to search for influencers in your niche. They might be using products/services from your niche and can prove beneficial in Instagram promotion of your product/service.

Another way to find influencers is through influencer platforms. You can reach them through your existing customers, as whom they consult or listen to on social media. For example, people follow beauty/makeup or fashion/health bloggers/Instagrammers who might be an influencer.

Influencers can promote your brand and product for a certain incentive on Instagram. Either give them content or ask for reviewing your product.

### 2\. Talk to them directly

You need to initiate talks with Instagram influencers for Instagram promotions. Influencers consume the product and if satisfied ask the brand to promote it. Sometimes there is no direct partnership between the influencer and the brand to promote a product.

You can approach an influencer to try your new product and review it on Instagram or work as joint fundraisers like contests and lucky draws. Genuine influencers who use your product and product voluntarily are really helpful for you.
