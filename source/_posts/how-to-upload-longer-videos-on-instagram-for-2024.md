Since Instagram's debut in 2010, it has become one of the most popular social media platforms globally. The app is optimized for mobile devices which are perfect for today's technological age. Users love communicating via high-quality pictures and videos with their friends and followers.

As users demand more ways to communicate, Instagram has been including additional features but with some limitations, requiring them to go through a complicated procedure to accomplish their goals such as uploading longer videos.

The length of the Instagram video depends on the type of content users wish to upload. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the video length requirements for different types.

1. Swipe right from anywhere in the Feed or tap the camera icon on the top left of the screen
2. Click ‚ÄúLive‚Äù at the bottom of the screen then record
3. Tap Friends with smiley icons
4. Choose the person‚Äôs name to invite them to join your live video and add more friends accordingly
