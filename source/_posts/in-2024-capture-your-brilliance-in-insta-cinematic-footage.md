## Different Types of Instagram Videos

### Story Videos

Instagram Story videos are short. So, pick Instagram video templates for short videos if this is what you want to post.

### Feed Videos

With templates, you can expedite content creation. That frees time that you can then use to shoot more videos or brainstorm new video ideas.
