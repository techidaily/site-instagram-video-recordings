Who doesn't love the Instagram stories? Well, the Instagram story stays on the account for only 24 hours yet leaves a profound impact on your audience, and the coolest part is the lack of algorithms in such stories. You don't need to crack any algorithm to get at the top of the News Feed. It will always be there. The simple reason for using the feature of the Instagram story is effectiveness. It may be the only way to stand out in the hot mess of Instagram, especially when you are a business brand.
