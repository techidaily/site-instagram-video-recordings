Instagram highlight covers or Instagram Story covers are little circles right below your IG profile bio. They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. **Creating Instagram highlight covers** is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic. However, the question is, how to make Instagram highlight covers?

No worries, here in this article, we will walk you through each step on how to create Instagram highlight covers.

## Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions

The highlight covers are small. Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.

Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.

When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16\. However, ensure that that the illustration is centered when you add it as your Instagram highlight icon.

## Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?

Instagram allows you to use just about any image you like for your highlight covers. However, if you want your brand to stand out among the competition, you must get past just any image. Highlight covers are a prime space to attract visitors, turn them into customers, and leave a lasting impression. So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.

There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.

Here is a step-by-step guide to follow on how to make highlight covers using the tool

**Step 1: Head over to canva.com or download the Canva App**

Once you are on the website, create your free account if you do not have one, and then log into your account. You can also download and install the Canva app on your iPhone or Android phone, and then log in to start using the app. In the following section, I will show you how to create the Instagram Story Highlight cover with Canva online.

**Step 2: Create a design for stories highlight cover**

![Canva create a highlight cover design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-create-a-design-ins-story-highlight-cover.jpg)

On the Canva homepage, click on **Create a design** tab at the right-hand upper corner. Now from the drop-down menu, you can type Instagram Story Highlight Cover in the search bar to locate it quickly, or you can scroll down to find it. The dimensions are automatically set as 1080 X 1920 pixels for Instagram story highlight in Canva, and if you don’t want to use this default size, you can click the Custom Size menu to identify the size, let’s say, 2000 \* 2000 pixels.

**Step 3: Select a background color or photo**

Canva provides fully customizable templates for highlight cover, you can drag one from the left pane to the blank canvas to start, add some texts or elements to customize.

![Canva highlight cover template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-instagram-highlight-cover-templates.jpg)

If you choose to create Instagram highlight covers from scratch without a template, you can follow the steps below.

On the design page, click on **Add Page** and then on the upper left side, you will see Background color, click on it and select the color you want to add. Alternatively, you can add your brand's hex code color. For the photos, you can either select a stock image from the Canva, connect your Instagram, or upload your own.

## Bonus: Tips for making better Instagram Highlight cover

Instagram highlight covers design should be such that it immediately grabs the attention of your audience. Since it forms a part of your brand aesthetics, the color and design elements you use should be consistent.

Here are a few tips to make better Instagram highlight covers.

**Conclusion**

Creating Instagram Highlight Covers is a quick and easy way to maintain your brand aesthetic and get more views.
