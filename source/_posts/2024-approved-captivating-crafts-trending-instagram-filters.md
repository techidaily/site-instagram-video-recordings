#### Promoting Posts on Stories

Another way to advertise your Instagram-based brand is to share the recent post as a story and hide it with some sticker. This will enhance the curiosity to see the actual post and bring them directly to your Instagram blog.

To do this like a pro, let me present to you [**Instagram Stories Pack Vol2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This pack permits the user to share their favorite posts and moments from the blog and let the world have a look at them in the most engaging way possible.
