## Part 2: Why Are Memes So Popular On Instagram, Anyway

 There are so many different reasons that memes have gotten a lot of traction over the years. In fact, they’ve become such a phenomenon that academics are actually starting to research them.

 Here are two of the big reasons why they’ve become a popular form of communication.

### 1\. Memes are Very Easy to Understand

 Memes are meant to be something that we use in order to easily communicate ideas with other people. Memes capture the essence of a thought in a creative way that everyone understands. They’re visual, they’re short, they catch our attention and they help people to grasp your thoughts in a quick, concise way.

### 2\. We Like Sharing Memes

 Think about it – if you see a meme that you find amusing or that fits you or someone you know really well, then you will share it to your social media page or send it to your friend. Sharing memes is a lot of fun, and so it’s become something that is really popular for many of us to do.

## Conclusion

 There are so many great memes out there for us to share and enjoy, and so it’s definitely worth it to find the Instagram accounts that you enjoy and that you’ll be able to use regularly to get a laugh and have fun with your friends.

 These are our favorites and they always seem to have the most hilarious memes. But you’re sure to find others that you’re going to want to follow and keep up with!
