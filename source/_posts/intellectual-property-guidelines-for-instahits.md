## Intellectual Property Guidelines for InstaHits

Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users. It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience's emotions.

However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.

This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram's rules about copyright music. We'll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.

## How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?

Firstly, let's look into the background of Instagram's working mechanism for copyright music detection.

Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn't stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.

Instagram's recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.

If the system detects copyrighted content, here's what happens to your Instagram account:

* Your post may be muted on Instagram.
* Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you're broadcasting a track during a Livestream.
* Instagram may take down your post entirely.

## Instagram Music Copyright Rules

After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.

Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:

* **Apply A Video When Sharing Music:** Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.
* **Keep The Video Short:** Make sure your video is short. Instagram's detection system will limit your content if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music.
* **Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:** If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music from its built-in music library.

## How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram

Under Instagram's automated detection system and copyright music rules, using copyrighted music is very important to ensure everything is right for your Instagram content.

In this part, we will focus on using royalty-free music on Instagram. We have prepared three aspects about its usage of it to provide overall guidance for you.

### (1) Workarounds for Using Copyrighted Music on Instagram

There are several workarounds for using **copyrighted music on Instagram:**

* **Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:** Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!
* **Asking For Permission:** To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.
* **Pay For The Copyrighted Music:** You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as [Pixaby,](https://pixabay.com/) [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), and [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/).
* **Give Credit In Your Caption:** To use copyrighted music on your IG content, give credit to the original creator in your post's caption.
* **Post Instagram Reel Videos:** Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song's details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.

### (2) A Video Editor To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram

Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram. However, there is a way to avoid issues and still post your content on the platform.

You can also remix tracks to make them sound different and add voiceover or other sound effects to make your videos unique.

### (3) Exceptions For Asking Permission To Use The Music

Here are some exceptions where you don't need to ask for permission to use copyrighted music in your IG posts, reels, or Livestreams:

* **Using Your Music:** You have all the necessary rights to use your music in your IG posts, Livestreams, or IGTV content.
* **Public Domain Songs:** Public Domain Songs is music with no official owner or official copyright protection and can be used however you want. You can find such soundtracks on the [Open Music Archive,](http://www.openmusicarchive.org/) [PD Info](https://www.pdinfo.com/), and [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main%5FPage) websites.

## Bonus: What Do You Do When Instagram Blocks Your Video?

Even though we have learned about the rules of using copyrighted music on Instagram, what to do if you are or have been in copyright issues?

Since Instagram uses an automated copyright detection system, your content might get blocked, muted, or removed. To avoid this from happening, you can place an appeal on the platform by following these steps:

Step1From the notification menu, click the copyright issue message, and you will be provided details of who reported your content and why.

If the original creator has reported you, their details will be displayed along with the reason.

Step2Read the notice that says you have permission to share the content in the video and tap the **"I agree"** option.

![making appeal on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-appeal-on-instagram.png)

Step3Tap the **"Appeal"** button. You can anticipate a decision within 24 hours. If you have adhered to the rules and possess the authority to use copyrighted music in your content, Instagram should lift all limitations.

**Does Instagram Have Its Copyright Music?**

Yes, Instagram offers a comprehensive library of royalty-free music you can use on your Stories and Reels. Simply click the "**Music**" icon while editing your post and find the soundtrack you want to add. This will, however, add a music sticker to your content.
