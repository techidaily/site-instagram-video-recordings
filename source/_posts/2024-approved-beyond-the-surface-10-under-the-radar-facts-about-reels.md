Instagram Reels are a fun and exciting new feature. It will indeed prove to be a massive success for Facebook as brands and content creators make and create Reels to promote and sell their stuff. But aside from that, it is an excellent addition to your Insta life! You can enjoy it with your friends or by yourself and use different effects and audios to make aesthetically pleasing clips! Happy Reeling!
