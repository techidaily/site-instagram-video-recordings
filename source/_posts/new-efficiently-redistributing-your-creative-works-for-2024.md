When a user posts something awesome on Instagram, it can be tempting to want to repost it yourself. However, when it comes to doing a repost, Instagram has made it deliberately less than easy to do so. In fact, their terms of use state you must seek permission to repost videos/photos on Instagram, either by commenting or direct messaging the content owner. If you have this consent in place, your next hurdle will be how to actually repost videos/photos on Instagram.

## How to Repost Photos and Video on Instagram

There are a few different ways to repost videos and photos on Instagram, so let's explore a couple of the most common and popular to see which is going to work for you.

* [Method 1: Use Apps](#part1)
* [Method 2: Screenshot](#part2)
* [Method 3: Share to other social media platforms](#part3)

### Method 1: Use Apps

The first way to repost Instagram content is via an app, and lucky for you, there are plenty of them out there. Here are five of the best for you to try out and see if you love:

#### 1\. **Repost for Instagram:**

![repost for instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-for-instagram.jpg)

Designed for iOS, this app is one of the best out there. It doesn't require any separate log in to be done, and is free, with minimal ads to interfere with the usability. It also doesn't watermark your repost, which is a big plus when you're not keen to advertise someone else's product for free.

Download for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id1120744554)

#### 2\. **Repost – Photo & Video Download And Save:**

![repost photo video download save](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-photo-video-download-save.jpg)

For the Android user, this is a great alternative that allows you to repost videos/photos on Instagram. It doesn't have a huge amount of features, but that does make it super simple to learn to use, so is great for the first time reposter. It does watermark the photo, however, and although free to download, requires payment to unlock the advanced features.

Download for[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.repost)

#### 3\. **Repost and Save for Instagram:**

![repost and save for instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-and-save-for-instagram.jpg)

Another app designed for iOS users to repost Instagram content, this one makes it super simple to not only repost but also to save that content onto your device. However, although it purports to be free, you'll need to shell out a few bucks to unlock even the most basic of features. However, if you don't mind paying, this is a solid choice that works with stories as well as video and photo content.

**Download for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-from-save-for-instagram/id1337649070)**

#### 4\. **Repost for Instagram Regrann:**

![repost for instagram ragrann](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-for-instagram-ragrann.jpg)

**Repost for Instagram – Regrann:** This pick is a cross-platform app to repost videos/photos on Instagram from both iOS and Android devices. It makes it easy to not only repost Instagram content, but also to credit the original owner in an unobtrusive manner. It works right from the Instagram app, so no need to leave the Insta-ecosystem to use it.

Download for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jaredco.regrann)
  
#### 5\. **RepostWhiz:**

![repost it whiz for ins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-it-whiz-for-ins.jpg)

Free on both Android and iOS, this is by far the smoothest app to repost Instagram video content. Photos are possible too, and from within the app you are able to search by user, likes or even hashtags. It allows you to schedule your reposts too, although, like many others, the app's name is unfortunately watermarked on your reposted content.

Download for[Android](https://apkpure.com/repostwhiz-repost-videos-photo/com.repostwhiz)
  
There are numerous other options for Instagram repost apps, each with its own set of pros and cons, so have a scout around and see what you can discover that suits your individual needs.

### Method 2: Screenshot

It's not an elegant solution, but it works, and we can all do it, no matter what device we're using. Screenshotting can be done via a variety of methods depending on your device. Samsungs, for instance, often accept a swipe of the side of the hand across the screen, whereas iPhones prefer a simultaneous press of the power and home button. The image on your screen will be stored on your camera roll.

To use this functionality to repost Instagram shots, simply navigate to the content you want to share, tap it to make it full screen, then screenshot it. You may need to crop it in your photo editor, or with some phones you'll be able to upload it just as it is. Now all you need to do is to upload it to your own Instagram account and you're done.

Screenshotting is pretty low on the copyright maintenance scale, so be sure to credit the original poster in your regram, otherwise, you could land up in hot water.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 3: Share to other social media platforms

To repost videos/photos on Instagram to other social networks is really easy, and is slightly more acceptable with grammers, as it can get them more traffic. To do it, click the three grey dots at the top of the post and copy the URL to your device's clipboard. To share it on Facebook, Twitter or anywhere else, just paste the link into your post.

If someone clicks on your reposted content, they will be taken to the original posters' Instagram account. This can drive extra followers to their feed, so most posters don't mind this method as much as screenshotting. However, it still makes sense to obtain permission, and to credit that person when you make your regram.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The final word

Being able to repost videos/photos on Instagram doesn't necessarily mean that you should. As previously mentioned, reposting without crediting the content owner is a copyright infringement and is against Instagram's terms of use. Taking other people's content and passing it off as your own is a big no-no, and at best will get your Instagram account suspended, at worst could result in a fine or criminal charge.

Seek permission, give credit where credit's due, and enjoy being able to repost Instagram content without infringing anyone's rights.

### Method 3: Share to other social media platforms

To repost videos/photos on Instagram to other social networks is really easy, and is slightly more acceptable with grammers, as it can get them more traffic. To do it, click the three grey dots at the top of the post and copy the URL to your device's clipboard. To share it on Facebook, Twitter or anywhere else, just paste the link into your post.

If someone clicks on your reposted content, they will be taken to the original posters' Instagram account. This can drive extra followers to their feed, so most posters don't mind this method as much as screenshotting. However, it still makes sense to obtain permission, and to credit that person when you make your regram.

### The final word

Being able to repost videos/photos on Instagram doesn't necessarily mean that you should. As previously mentioned, reposting without crediting the content owner is a copyright infringement and is against Instagram's terms of use. Taking other people's content and passing it off as your own is a big no-no, and at best will get your Instagram account suspended, at worst could result in a fine or criminal charge.

Seek permission, give credit where credit's due, and enjoy being able to repost Instagram content without infringing anyone's rights.

When a user posts something awesome on Instagram, it can be tempting to want to repost it yourself. However, when it comes to doing a repost, Instagram has made it deliberately less than easy to do so. In fact, their terms of use state you must seek permission to repost videos/photos on Instagram, either by commenting or direct messaging the content owner. If you have this consent in place, your next hurdle will be how to actually repost videos/photos on Instagram.

## How to Repost Photos and Video on Instagram

There are a few different ways to repost videos and photos on Instagram, so let's explore a couple of the most common and popular to see which is going to work for you.

* [Method 1: Use Apps](#part1)
* [Method 2: Screenshot](#part2)
* [Method 3: Share to other social media platforms](#part3)

### Method 1: Use Apps

The first way to repost Instagram content is via an app, and lucky for you, there are plenty of them out there. Here are five of the best for you to try out and see if you love:

#### 1\. **Repost for Instagram:**

<a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![repost for instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-for-instagram.jpg)

Designed for iOS, this app is one of the best out there. It doesn't require any separate log in to be done, and is free, with minimal ads to interfere with the usability. It also doesn't watermark your repost, which is a big plus when you're not keen to advertise someone else's product for free.

Download for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id1120744554)

#### 2\. **Repost – Photo & Video Download And Save:**

![repost photo video download save](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-photo-video-download-save.jpg)

For the Android user, this is a great alternative that allows you to repost videos/photos on Instagram. It doesn't have a huge amount of features, but that does make it super simple to learn to use, so is great for the first time reposter. It does watermark the photo, however, and although free to download, requires payment to unlock the advanced features.

Download for[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.repost)

#### 3\. **Repost and Save for Instagram:**

![repost and save for instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-and-save-for-instagram.jpg)

Another app designed for iOS users to repost Instagram content, this one makes it super simple to not only repost but also to save that content onto your device. However, although it purports to be free, you'll need to shell out a few bucks to unlock even the most basic of features. However, if you don't mind paying, this is a solid choice that works with stories as well as video and photo content.

**Download for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-from-save-for-instagram/id1337649070)**

#### 4\. **Repost for Instagram Regrann:**

![repost for instagram ragrann](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-for-instagram-ragrann.jpg)

**Repost for Instagram – Regrann:** This pick is a cross-platform app to repost videos/photos on Instagram from both iOS and Android devices. It makes it easy to not only repost Instagram content, but also to credit the original owner in an unobtrusive manner. It works right from the Instagram app, so no need to leave the Insta-ecosystem to use it.

Download for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jaredco.regrann)
  
#### 5\. **RepostWhiz:**

![repost it whiz for ins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/repost-it-whiz-for-ins.jpg)

Free on both Android and iOS, this is by far the smoothest app to repost Instagram video content. Photos are possible too, and from within the app you are able to search by user, likes or even hashtags. It allows you to schedule your reposts too, although, like many others, the app's name is unfortunately watermarked on your reposted content.

Download for[Android](https://apkpure.com/repostwhiz-repost-videos-photo/com.repostwhiz)
  
There are numerous other options for Instagram repost apps, each with its own set of pros and cons, so have a scout around and see what you can discover that suits your individual needs.

### Method 2: Screenshot

It's not an elegant solution, but it works, and we can all do it, no matter what device we're using. Screenshotting can be done via a variety of methods depending on your device. Samsungs, for instance, often accept a swipe of the side of the hand across the screen, whereas iPhones prefer a simultaneous press of the power and home button. The image on your screen will be stored on your camera roll.

To use this functionality to repost Instagram shots, simply navigate to the content you want to share, tap it to make it full screen, then screenshot it. You may need to crop it in your photo editor, or with some phones you'll be able to upload it just as it is. Now all you need to do is to upload it to your own Instagram account and you're done.

Screenshotting is pretty low on the copyright maintenance scale, so be sure to credit the original poster in your regram, otherwise, you could land up in hot water.

To repost videos/photos on Instagram to other social networks is really easy, and is slightly more acceptable with grammers, as it can get them more traffic. To do it, click the three grey dots at the top of the post and copy the URL to your device's clipboard. To share it on Facebook, Twitter or anywhere else, just paste the link into your post.

If someone clicks on your reposted content, they will be taken to the original posters' Instagram account.

However, it still makes sense to obtain permission, and to credit that person when you make your regram.
