Unzip them and transfer them to your phone via your preferred method.

## Part 3: How to Upload a Highlight Cover on Instagram

Before you upload the highlight covers on Instagram, ensure you turn on the Archive feature. Go to your Instagram settings and select the story settings and then turn on the Save to Archive. This enables you to see your old stories without downloading them.

As we said before, you should transfer the created highlight cover photos from desktop to you phone, and then click on your Instagram profile and add a new highlight, follow the instructions on the screen to edit cover and then add the highlight cover photo you just created, give it a name, and click on Done. Your new Insta Story Highlight appears at the bottom of your Instagram bio.

## Part 4: How to Change Existing Highlight Cover on Instagram?

If you have existing highlight covers, you can easily edit and change them. Go to your Instagram profile, go to the Highlights section and press and hold the highlight cover that you want to change, tap **More** and then tap on **Edit Highlight**, and then on **Edit Cover**. Find the photo you want to use as a new cover for the highlight, and click on it and tap on Done.

Besides changing highlight cover, here you can edit the highlight and add old stories or delete the images you do not want.

## Bonus: Tips for making better Instagram Highlight cover

Instagram highlight covers design should be such that it immediately grabs the attention of your audience. Since it forms a part of your brand aesthetics, the color and design elements you use should be consistent.

Here are a few tips to make better Instagram highlight covers.

**Tip #1 – Have the Same Style**

When creating Insta highlight covers with either a photo, icons, typography, or illustrations, keep the same style across all covers. A compilation of different styles makes your highlight covers disorganized and difficult to follow.

**Tip #2 – Be Precise**

Highlight covers have a small viewing window. Make sure the design is easy to read and clear. Simple designs are perfect for highlight covers as they are easy to see for your audience.

**Tip #3 – Incorporate Your Brand Assets**

Instagram highlight covers are an extension of your brand. Incorporating your brand's assets is an excellent way to make your highlights feel more professional. You can include your brand voice and style. Or go with the colors, fonts, or design trademarks that you use on other channels.

**Conclusion**

Creating Instagram Highlight Covers is a quick and easy way to maintain your brand aesthetic and get more views. Putting in some time and effort into creating beautiful, high-quality highlight covers benefits you in many ways. It helps increase brand awareness, showcase your most valuable Instagram Stories content, and attract new followers. Use this post as your go-to guide on how to make Instagram highlight covers using Canva. It will take you just a few minutes to create awesome IG highlight covers, so go ahead and get started now with Canva.
