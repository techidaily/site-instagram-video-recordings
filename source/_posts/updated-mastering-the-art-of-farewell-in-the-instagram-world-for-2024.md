Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms around the world with about [1 million](https://backlinko.com/instagram-users) active users every month and a total of 1.074 billion users in 2021\. Most people don’t realize time flying while using Instagram and it can become very addictive.

This problem is sorted out by deactivating or deleting the Instagram account. The difference between deleting an Instagram account and deactivating an Instagram account is that while deleting is permanent, deactivating is temporary.

Let’s have a look at how both these actions can be performed in case you feel like Instagram is impacting your life more than it’s needed.

## Part 1: How to Delete an Instagram Account Permanently

If you are choosing to delete an Instagram account it is important to know that this is a permanent process and you will lose all the data along with your account.

To delete an account:

**Step 1**: [Log in](https://www.instagram.com/) to your Instagram account from your web browser using your credentials

![log-in-instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-log-in-instagram.jpg)

**Step 2**: After logging in, [click here](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/) and you will be diverted to the accounts deleting page of Instagram

**Step 3**: Choose the reason why you wish to delete your Instagram account from the drop-down tab and enter your password for security verification. Then click on Delete (Your account name) tab.

![delete-instagram-account-page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-delete-instagram-account-page.jpg)

Instagram will display a message saying that your account will be erased within a month and until then it will be hidden from the rest of the Instagram users. You will also be notified via your email id if it was added to your account.
