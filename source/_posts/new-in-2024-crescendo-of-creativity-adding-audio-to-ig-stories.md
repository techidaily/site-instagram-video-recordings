_I see a lot of Instagram stories with songs posted, but I don’t know how to do that. Can someone tell me how to **add music to IG story**?_

If you are also an avid Instagram user who would like to post stories on the app, then you can have a similar query. Although, the feature of Instagram Music was only available in selected countries in 2018 – today, it is accessible almost everywhere. It lets us add a song (and its lyrics) to our Instagram story for our viewers with tons of customized options. Since it makes our stories more fun, a lot of people add music to IG story every now and then. Without much ado, let’s proceed and learn how to put music on IG story in detail.

## A Step-by-step Guide for Adding Music to IG Story

To make it easier for us to post interesting stories, Instagram has come up with the Music feature. Using it, we can look for tons of popular songs in different languages and add our favorite snippets to our story. Presently, the feature of Instagram Music is available for English, German, French, Hindi, and a few other local languages. Also, you can post a snippet of at most 15 seconds since that is the maximum duration of an Instagram story. To learn how to add music to the IG story, you can follow these simple steps right away:

#### 1. Select the Music feature for IG story

To start with, just launch the Instagram application on your phone and tap on the “Add Story” button. You can find it on the top-left corner of the screen, depicted by a “+” sign with your profile picture.

This will launch a dedicated interface for Instagram Story. Here, you can use your camera to click a picture or record a mini video. If you want, you can also upload an existing picture or video as your story as well. Once you have taken a snap, just scroll up your screen to get various add-on features for your story. From here, just tap on the “Music” option to add music to IG story.

#### 2. Select any song of your choice

As of now, Instagram music has an extensive catalog with millions of songs in different languages and genres. As you would tap on the “Music” option, it will automatically suggest numerous songs that are trending. If you want, you can tap on the search bar and enter keywords for songs, artists, albums, etc. to look for anything specific.

Once you find the song of your choice, just tap on it and it will be loaded on the Instagram Story interface. Although the entire song would be loaded, you would now have to clip a snippet of at most 15 seconds from it. There is a slider at the bottom that you can move and adjust to clip the specific part and even view its lyrics sliding as you move.

#### 3. Make optional edits to customize the story

If you want, you can just post the song right away after learning how to put music on IG story. Though, a lot of people would like to make changes in the story to make it look presentable. For instance, you can see a timer (that is set to 15 seconds by default) at the bottom-left panel. Just tap on it and adjust the duration for your story that can be anywhere from 2 to 15 seconds.

If you want, you can zoom in or out the text and move it to display it the way you like. Furthermore, there is a color radiant option on the top that you can select to change the text color and background.

If you don’t want to display the lyrics, then just swipe the text options at the bottom and select the sticker feature. This will only display the sticker of the track on the story. You can also tap on the sticker to get different display options for it.
