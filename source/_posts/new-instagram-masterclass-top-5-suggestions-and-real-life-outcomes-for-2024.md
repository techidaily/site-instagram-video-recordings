### 5\. Call to action

 A call to action within the visual content or caption can make things easier and clear for your viewers. While creating an Instagram campaign, it is essential to have a call to action within your video content which engages your audiences deeply with your brand.

 Never make your content too sales-oriented, instead, consider driving your traffic to take a clear call for a certain reason by directing them to a specific page. The Instagram page and its specific segments are visited more than 11 times per day and it is definitely a sticky platform. So, you need to give your audience some very strong reason to leave the platform and move to your page as you want.
