Instagram has launched a new longer-form video app for content creators named IGTV on June 2018, which allows you to upload a longer video, while in Instagram Stories, the video length is limited to 15 seconds, and the video in main feeds can be 60 seconds.

Though IGTV allows you to upload portrait/vertical videos only with a minimum 4:5/a maximum 9:16 aspect ratio, at present, Instagram still displays square video (1:1 aspect ratio), portrait video (5:4 aspect ratio) and landscape video (16:9 aspect ratio).

We recommend you to use Filmora video editor to edit your Instagram videos because:

* Filmora allows you to customize your Instagram video project to any ratio you want, besides the common 1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3 and 21:9 aspect ratio. You can open Filmora, go to File-Project Settings, and then input the resolution you want to customize the project ratio.
