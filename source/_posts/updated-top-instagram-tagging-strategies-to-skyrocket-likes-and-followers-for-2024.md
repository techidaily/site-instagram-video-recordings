## How Many Hashtags Are Too Many for Instagram

There is [some discussion](https://www.quora.com/How-many-hashtags-are-too-many-on-instagram) as to how many hashtags are too many, and while there isn’t a hard and fast rule, there are some considerations that you need to make. Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.

Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.

Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.

## Top Instagram Hashtags for Lifestyle

We’ve all got a different definition of what our “lifestyle” is, but in the context of these 5 hashtags, it’s about how you live your life and what you can do to make that life even better.

![lifestyle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-lifestyle.JPG)

1. **#lifestyleblog –** Have a lifestyle blog you’re promoting or do you use your Insta as one? That'll help to share it!
2. **#lifestyle –** Once again, sometimes the most obvious hashtags are most effective.
3. **#livecolorfully –** Lifestyle blogs and posts focus a lot on being yourself and living colorfully can be a big part of that!
4. **#love –** Love, relationships, friendships, and everything in between are included in this hashtag, usually.
5. **#thehappynow** – Lifestyle blogs focus on happiness and this hashtag gets a lot of attention for that reason.

## How Many Hashtags Are Too Many for Instagram

There is [some discussion](https://www.quora.com/How-many-hashtags-are-too-many-on-instagram) as to how many hashtags are too many, and while there isn’t a hard and fast rule, there are some considerations that you need to make. Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.

Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.

Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.
