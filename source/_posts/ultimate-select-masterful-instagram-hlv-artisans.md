We are living in an age of social media, and the intensive sharing of photos, which millions can see, is commonplace on a daily level. No doubt, one of the most popular social platforms around the world is Instagram, with the exciting option - IG Story. With this feature, posted photos and short videos disappear after 24 hours. The only thing you can do to save them on your account is to add them to Highlights. Since Instagram doesn't support making cover itself on the app, you need a dedicated third-party tool to do it. With Instagram highlight cover maker online, you can create a specific cover for the Highlights icon, and make your content more attractive for your followers.

In the next paragraphs, we introduce you to 10 of the best online Instagram Highlight cover maker apps.

## Best online Instagram Highlight Cover Makers

The app includes a lot of pre-designed samples, free stock photos, illustrations, music, frames, and more, which you can use to create the cover. Of course, you can produce a unique cover starting the creative process from a blank canvas, or upload your own photo from a PC or mobile phone.

When you open the Canvas maker, add a circle on the page, select some of the offered graphics and choose the colors.
