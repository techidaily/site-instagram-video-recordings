## Different Types of Instagram Videos

There are different types of Instagram videos. It can affect which templates you should use and not use. So, let's discuss this first. The different types of Instagram videos are:

### Story Videos

Instagram has a feature called "Instagram Stories." These are ephemeral content, meaning they disappear after 24 hours.

Instagram Story videos are short. So, pick Instagram video templates for short videos if this is what you want to post.

### Feed Videos

These videos are the ones you see while scrolling on your feed. You upload them like how you upload photos. You can use either the in-app camera to shoot a fresh one or upload one from your phone. These videos can have a length of up to 1 hour

### Live Videos

Live videos are long-form videos that show your viewers what you are doing in real time. There's no template for this.

### Reels

Instagram Reels are short-form videos. They often feature effects, overlays, and music. They have their own section on Instagram, and unlike Stories, they don't disappear.

## What Are Instagram Video Templates?

Instagram video templates are videos that are already pre-made. They exist to help content creators who have an idea but need more to make a video.

You probably had times like that. You know what video you want to make. But you struggle to find the perfect music to go with your video. The clip arrangement, transitions, and effects are also big question marks.

Video templates help you solve these problems. They already have the music, effects, and such figured out. What's left to do is for you to edit them with your clips and captions.

With templates, you can expedite content creation. That frees time that you can then use to shoot more videos or brainstorm new video ideas.

## Different Types of Instagram Videos

There are different types of Instagram videos. It can affect which templates you should use and not use. So, let's discuss this first. The different types of Instagram videos are:

### Story Videos

Instagram has a feature called "Instagram Stories." These are ephemeral content, meaning they disappear after 24 hours.

Instagram Story videos are short. So, pick Instagram video templates for short videos if this is what you want to post.

These videos are the ones you see while scrolling on your feed. You upload them like how you upload photos. You can use either the in-app camera to shoot a fresh one or upload one from your phone. These videos can have a length of up to 1 hour

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Live Videos

Live videos are long-form videos that show your viewers what you are doing in real time. There's no template for this.

### Reels

Instagram Reels are short-form videos. They often feature effects, overlays, and music. They have their own section on Instagram, and unlike Stories, they don't disappear.

## What Are Instagram Video Templates?

Instagram video templates are videos that are already pre-made. They exist to help content creators who have an idea but need more to make a video.

You probably had times like that. You know what video you want to make. But you struggle to find the perfect music to go with your video. The clip arrangement, transitions, and effects are also big question marks.

Video templates help you solve these problems. They already have the music, effects, and such figured out. What's left to do is for you to edit them with your clips and captions.

With templates, you can expedite content creation. That frees time that you can then use to shoot more videos or brainstorm new video ideas.

## How To Use Instagram Video Templates?

Where can you find Instagram video templates? They are in many places. But the best place they can be is inside a video editing app. That streamlines the process, as you can find the template and edit it in one place. What's a good app with Instagram video templates, you may ask. Wondershare Filmora for Mobile is one of them.
