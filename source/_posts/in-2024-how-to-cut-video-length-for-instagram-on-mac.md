## Conclusion

However, these two ways of cutting video length to fit Instagram have their advantages and disadvantages.

| **Advantages including:**    | Provide more details in less time.                                                                                                                                                | Attention is the new currency. To get more viewers for your Instagram video as users are quickly scrolling the news feed to find cool videos, yours has to increase watching speed. Again, you get to pass more details to your audience in less time. |

| Create a cinematic feel      | Increased video speed creates a motion effect that makes the video cool to watch. This can draw attention to your Instagram viewers resulting in more engagement.                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Corrects missing timestamps  | When recording Instagram videos, you sometimes record not as clear due to camera motion. With accelerating speed, you can correct these errors and remove any missing timestamps. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Disadvantages including:** | Audio distortion                                                                                                                                                                  | When increasing video speed, the audio is affected. To get the original sound, you need to edit it. Or better yet, you can add a new soundtrack, which will you a little more time to edit.                                                            |
| Increased video size         | When accelerating the speed of Instagram video when editing increases the video size, this, in turn, loads very slow when uploading on Instagram.                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
