#### 7\. [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)

 Sprout Social combines analytics tools with the tools you can use to schedule posts on several different social media platforms, including Instagram. It is probably not best suited for small marketing teams because its features were designed to improve the workflow of large companies and teams that need to manage large databases. Its price suggests the same, since the cheapest version of Sprout Social you can get costs $99, while the most expensive option for enterprises costs $249.
