## Part 2: How to Add Music to Instagram without Music Stickers?

Instagram music works in most cases, but it may be useless if you do not find music of your choice. Sometimes, you want to add a specific song to go with the video's vibe or a photo. In that case, you can upload music using other methods as well. Here, we will share four ways to put music to Instagram stories without stickers.

### **Method 1: Add music** **to Instagram through Spotify Music**

Thanks to the update from both partners, i.e., Instagram and Spotify, which teamed up back in 2018, now you don't have to share a screenshot of a song from Spotify to let the audience know what you're listening to!

Spotify has millions of songs to listen to and add to your library. You can post all the songs you listen to on your stories to make your content look more appealing. Let's have a look at a few steps that you can use to post music from Spotify on Instagram:

**Step 1: Log in to Spotify** and **select a song:**

**Log in to** your existing account or create a new one. Select one of the songs from your list or search for the one you like. You will see **three dots** on the right corner; click on them.

**Step 2: Select Instagram stories**

When you click on the three dots, you will be presented with a few options; click **on share**. After clicking on share, you will see a few apps options; click **on Instagram stories**.

**Step 3: Post**

When you **click on the Instagram stories option**, the cover art will automatically upload to your stories. You can add a filter or change its placement before posting.

### Method 2: Upload music on Instagram stories through SoundCloud

SoundCloud is one of the apps that we all have used at some point in our lives to listen to our favorite music tracks. It also has options to make separate genre playlists to listen to according to your mood. On top of all, you can now add music to Instagram stories via SoundCloud in some simple steps.

**Step 1: Login and search music**

To begin the process, you first have to **log in to your account** and search for the song you want to post on your stories in your playlist. To **share music on Instagram**, you have to **click on the three dots,** the ellipsis sign below the song.

S**tep 2: Select Instagram stories**

When you **select the ellipsis sign,** you will see a few options and an Instagram logo. You will see stories written beneath the logo; click on **Instagram stories**.

**Step 3: Post**

The song will be shared to the stories, **make changes you want, and post**.

### Method 3: Share Music to Instagram through Apple Music

Apple Music is one of the best music apps which many people use to listen to their favorite songs. It is an iOS app through which you can also post music on Instagram stories. Let's see how to post music through Apple Music on Instagram stories.

**Step 1: Click to identify a song**

Go to Apple Music and play the song you want to post on your Instagram story.

**Step 2: Click to open drop-down options**

When you are listening to the song, you will see three vertical dots. **Click on the vertical dots** to get share options.

S**tep 3: Click share on Insta stories**

When you click on three vertical dots, you will have a few options. **Click on share** and proceed to **select the Instagram stories option**.

Note: You might have to click on "More" on some smartphones.
