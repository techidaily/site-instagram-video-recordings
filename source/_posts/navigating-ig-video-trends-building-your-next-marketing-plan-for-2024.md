 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Instagram has evolved over the years and has reached [1 billion active users each month](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/).

 But, do you think it was just the logo? No, there were many other big changes too. From the introduction of several business profiles on Instagram to unveiling new tools, Instagram video marketing is on the roll.

 If you are a business owner, you definitely cannot ignore the power of Instagram video marketing, so in this article, we will let you know how to make Instagram video marketing plan in 8 steps, and the excellent Instagram video ideas.

* [**Part 1: You Need To Understand IG First**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: 10 Best Instagram Video Ideas You Should Know**](#part3)

## Part 1: You Need To Understand IG First

 If you market a product without knowing the culture, tastes, or likes of the people around, you are most likely to fail. So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.

 For instance, when the brand [Pepsi selected China to expand](https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-pepsi-expands/), the launch slogan was “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” which was misinterpreted by the people as “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave”. This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.

 So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies. You must know the audience and understand their choices, likes, and what can drive them to your video.

## Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing

### Step 1: Know Your Objective

 To ensure a successful Instagram video marketing strategy, it is important that your videos are not just moving pieces without any message to convey. There has to be some [key objective for your Instagram video](https://animoto.com/blog/business/video-marketing-objectives).

 However, every video may not have a thoughtful or reflective objective because product launches or major announcements and not done each and every week. Whatever the objective of your video is, the moving images must tell a story that the audiences can accept and turn to again and again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 2: Keep Your Video Short

 A singular post on Instagram can have up to a 60 minutes long video but, you must keep it [crisp, interesting, sweet, and short](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/creating-short-snackable-videos-instagram-lindsay-ostrom/). No matter what the video length is, you must ensure that the video must be able to deliver the strong message that it intends to. The primary objective of the video must be to come across clearly without confusing the viewers.

 It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.

 You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 3: Make High-Quality Video

 You must never compromise on the quality of the video when it comes to [how to make Instagram video](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos). In order to generate traffic, always ensure that your content is compelling.

 By giving a sneak peek into behind the scene glimpses, upcoming product launches or something relevant can create interest amongst the people and make them take action. The [explainer videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the best ones in this category as it unleashes the power of emotional content.

### Step 4: Add to CTA

 Your video must be able to direct the audience to [take a call to action](https://www.plannthat.com/call-to-action-instagram/). What do you want the users to do once the video is over? The call to action helps in conversion. It is not really necessary for you to add a call to action button within the video but when your video has got attention from the viewers, the next step automatically becomes a clear call to action for the viewers.

 If you wish to increase your Brand’s Insta following, make sure your call to action for the users must be “follow the Instagram page for more updates. If you want the users to share the video, you must ask the user to tag a like-minded friend. Be as much creative as you can with the words and language.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 5: Use Hashtags

 Hashtags can be really helpful at times. The [top hashtags on IG](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used to submit the videos on Instagram, enter any contest, or for live events promotion. When you have huge viewers base on Instagram, the hashtag is the best method to engage with your audience, develop your brand’s loyalty, and get user-generated content.

### Step 6: Your Videos Should Be Topical

 Leveraging dates for content opportunities can be a great Instagram video marketing tip. You can get several opportunities to create great topical videos at any point of time so keeping an eye on the pop culture and current affairs can be beneficial. It helps the brand to reach a wider audience by hashtagging and topical visuals.

![Instagram Video Marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/ig-video.jpg)

### Step 7: Shoot Special Moment

 To highlight the special offers and promotions available with the video, 60 seconds might seem a long time. Adding a special and personal message by flipping the view mode on the camera, you can create interest amongst the potential buyer and fans.

 The message from you can be anything like win a certain gift or highlight the points that can help you win during the sale, etc. You may highlight the video message by adding a hashtag for tracking conversions.

![Instagram Video Marketing Special Moment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/special-moment-ig.jpg)

### Step 8: Use Instagram Analytics

 Analyzing and evaluating constantly where you stand and how you can improve your Instagram video marketing strategies is very important at every stage of your promotions. You may [use the Instagram analytics tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to track and monitor your performance and trend, check hashtag uses and comments, identify influencers, measure the audience engagements and more.

### 6\. Video Slideshow

 The best part of the slide shows is you do not need any video clips to create it. If you are apprehensive about creating a video, you may just pick a few images and get your way through PowerPoint and make a slideshow.

 Although, it is seen that people mute the videos while watching it, there’s nothing more powerful than a relevant and unique soundtrack. A smart and economical way to show your brand personality, [making music video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) invokes direct emotion that no long narration or text can ever do.

 Music concludes and completes your video by perfecting or complementing the speed of motion onscreen. Choosing the perfect music track is one of the most difficult decisions a video editor has to make. Instagram video ideas are many but if you leave music, you will be leaving out something most vital.
