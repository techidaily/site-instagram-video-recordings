The business is done with the people, and the audience often prefers the brand that keeps its team in the loop. It is an amazing idea to first introduce the brand and answer questions like what it is bringing to the table, the target market, and how you are willing to solve problems. In the same way, the team introduction will also develop an emotional connection with the people.
