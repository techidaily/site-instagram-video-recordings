## What Makes a Good Boomerang?

* [1.Make Simple Moments Look Special](#part6)
* [2.Add on the Loop](#part7)
* [3.Boomerang Selfies](#part8)

#### 1.Make Simple Moments Look Special

You could start by using this app to add a touch of fun, even to mundane moments. For instance, the flip of the hair could look good with this app. When you are a beginner you can make a simple action captured over video look mesmerizing as you put it in the loop. Hence, a good tip to make a boomerang from a video is to not hesitate in using the app on a simple moment captured on video. It could be moments such as putting on a jacket, a dance move, a runway walk, and so forth.

![Boomerang Catch Special Moments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boomerang-catch-special-moments.jpg)

#### 2.Add on the Loop

Boomerangs are perfect when you add on a loop. This includes a forward movement, followed by a backward movement, and then forward again. For the loop to be added perfectly, finish movement in a different place than when you first started. For instance, if you wish to loop a dance move, you need to move the recording phone across the dance floor. This will capture the movement completely.

#### 3.Boomerang Selfies

Did you think that only videos could be boomeranged? You can boomerang photos as well. To start with an experiment, try doing it with your selfie. You could move your hair, wink, smile, or play with your jacket. These are all effects that capture this app very well. It would certainly help make your selfies or profile pics special.
