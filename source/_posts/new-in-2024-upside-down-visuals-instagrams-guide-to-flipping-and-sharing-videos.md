## Why Rotate Videos for Instagram?

Have you ever captured a video in landscape or horizontal mode on your smartphone, only to realize it's not quite right for Instagram? The platform is optimized for portrait or vertical videos, so videos captured in landscape mode may not fit the screen properly. This leads to having black bars on the sides or a distorted aspect ratio. To correct this, you must rotate the video to fit the screen perfectly.

By rotating your videos, you can ensure that your content is properly oriented and displayed for maximum impact on the platform. Whether you need to rotate a video 90 degrees or adjust it slightly, the process is simple and can be done on both desktop and mobile devices.
