### 3\. Check Engagement

 The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers.

Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10\. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.
