<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Find Influencers first

Use hashtags to search for influencers in your niche. They might be using products/services from your niche and can prove beneficial in Instagram promotion of your product/service.

Another way to find influencers is through influencer platforms. You can reach them through your existing customers, as whom they consult or listen to on social media. For example, people follow beauty/makeup or fashion/health bloggers/Instagrammers who might be an influencer.

Influencers can promote your brand and product for a certain incentive on Instagram. Either give them content or ask for reviewing your product.

### 2\. Talk to them directly

You need to initiate talks with Instagram influencers for Instagram promotions. Influencers consume the product and if satisfied ask the brand to promote it. Sometimes there is no direct partnership between the influencer and the brand to promote a product.

You can approach an influencer to try your new product and review it on Instagram or work as joint fundraisers like contests and lucky draws. Genuine influencers who use your product and product voluntarily are really helpful for you.

Instagram influencers consider that an influencer platform is the ultimate way to get in touch with brands. Such a platform offers a third-party neutral arena for meeting brands. You can discover new influencers and they can find you as well. A sense of security is there for both parties, as there are certain terms of use governed by the platform.
