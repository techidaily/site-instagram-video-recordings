## Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks

 The key to success in life is consistency. The same can be said for Instagram since you can't really expect to get thousands of likes on each post if you don't add new content to your Instagram account consistently. Let's explore Instagram's hidden tips and tricks and see how you can enjoy even more success on this unique platform.

### 1\. Download videos and photos in batches

 Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.

[Insta-downloader.net](http://insta-downloader.net/) is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account. You just have to copy the URL of a photo or Instagram profile and click the Download button.

### 2\. Upload photos and videos from your computer

 The Instagram app can't be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and [post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 3\. Repost Instagram photos and videos

 There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn't allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the [Repost app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.

### 4\. Post multiple photos at the same time

 Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.

 The 'Select Multiple' feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.

### 5\. Add hashtags after posting

[Instagram hashtags](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a powerful tool that can get your posts a lot of exposure and new followers, but they don't work on other social media like Facebook or Twitter. That's why you should post and share a photo or a video first, and then tap on the Edit button to add the hashtags you want to your Instagram post.

 In this manner, you'll be able to save a lot of time on deleting hashtags from the posts you shared on Facebook, Tumblr or any other social media platform.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Add a URL to your bio

 Featuring links to your blog or website in posts on Instagram or in comments is yet another thing you can't do on this platform. However, if you want to direct traffic from your Instagram account to a website or a blog you can [add a URL to your bio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The trick is to change the URL every time you start promoting a different project.

 This tip can help you promote the products and services you're offering on Instagram, and in addition, it can boost the conversion rates on your website, simply because more people will be able to see it.

### 7\. Send photos privately to a specific friend

 Tagging a friend in a post and having a public debate is not in accordance with everyone's taste. Instagram however, provides the option to send a photo or a video to a friend privately. Having a private chat is a much better option if you had a more meaningful communication in mind than just exchanging a few emojis.

 Furthermore, you can also send private messages to your Instagram followers by going to their profile and tapping on the Options icon that looks like three vertical black dots. Select the Send Message feature and enjoy chatting with your friends on Instagram.

### 8\. Use Instagram as a photo editor

 The photo editing features Instagram offers are truly magical, so if you need to edit a photo quickly you can use Instagram to do it. Enabling the Airplane mode will prevent the photo from being posted on your account, so before you start editing you should first switch to the Airplane mode, and make sure that the Instagram's Save Original Photo option is activated.

 Import the photo you'd like to edit to the Instagram app and apply filters or increase contrast or balance on your photo, and then proceed to share the picture. The app will report an error and inform you that the photo cannot be posted to your Instagram account, but the picture you edited will be saved in the photo gallery.

### 9\. Schedule posts in advance

 Social media campaigns depend on punctuality, which is the reason why scheduling Instagram posts is a strategy that might result in a better performance of your account. However, this Instagram tip works only if you have a Business profile on Instagram, and you'll also have to get a social media scheduling tool and a HubSpot software.

 The actual steps you'll need to take in order to schedule a post depend on the social media scheduling tool you are using, so some additional research may be required before you can start scheduling your Instagram posts.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 10\. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post

 If you want to, you can get notifications for each post from your friends, business associates, and influencers. Turning on notifications on Instagram is easy since all you need to do is go to the Instagram user's profile and select the 'Turn on Post Notifications' options from the Settings menu. The settings icon looks like three black dots, in case you are having trouble finding it.

 However, if you would like this trick to work you must allow Instagram to send you notifications in the first place. Head over to your phone's Settings menu, select the Apps option, locate the Instagram app and choose the feature that enables notifications.

### 11\. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day

 The ephemeral content is becoming more popular every day, but some Instagram Stories deserve more attention than they can get in a single day. If you would like your Instagram Stories to stay online for longer than 24 hours you can create Story Highlights.

 Simply click on the + icon below the profile picture on your Instagram account and select the stories you want to feature in the Story Highlight from the album. The Story Highlights will be visible on your Instagram profile, for as long as you want. Removing or changing the Story Highlights is a simple process that won't take more than five minutes of your time.

### 12\. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts

 A good Instagram account is coherent because Instagrammers interested in fashion have almost zero interest in sports, so if you want to post images that cover both of these topics it is best to create different accounts. Instagram lets its users manage up to 5 interconnected accounts, which opens a plethora of opportunities for big companies that offer more than just one service as well as for up and coming startups that are looking for a big breakthrough in a certain niche.

 If you want to create a new Instagram account, go to Options and tap on the Add New Account feature. You can use the same username and password for all of your Instagram accounts.

### 5\. Add hashtags after posting

[Instagram hashtags](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a powerful tool that can get your posts a lot of exposure and new followers, but they don't work on other social media like Facebook or Twitter. That's why you should post and share a photo or a video first, and then tap on the Edit button to add the hashtags you want to your Instagram post.

 In this manner, you'll be able to save a lot of time on deleting hashtags from the posts you shared on Facebook, Tumblr or any other social media platform.

### 6\. Add a URL to your bio

 Featuring links to your blog or website in posts on Instagram or in comments is yet another thing you can't do on this platform. However, if you want to direct traffic from your Instagram account to a website or a blog you can [add a URL to your bio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The trick is to change the URL every time you start promoting a different project.

 This tip can help you promote the products and services you're offering on Instagram, and in addition, it can boost the conversion rates on your website, simply because more people will be able to see it.

### 7\. Send photos privately to a specific friend

 Tagging a friend in a post and having a public debate is not in accordance with everyone's taste. Instagram however, provides the option to send a photo or a video to a friend privately. Having a private chat is a much better option if you had a more meaningful communication in mind than just exchanging a few emojis.

 Furthermore, you can also send private messages to your Instagram followers by going to their profile and tapping on the Options icon that looks like three vertical black dots. Select the Send Message feature and enjoy chatting with your friends on Instagram.

### 8\. Use Instagram as a photo editor

 The photo editing features Instagram offers are truly magical, so if you need to edit a photo quickly you can use Instagram to do it. Enabling the Airplane mode will prevent the photo from being posted on your account, so before you start editing you should first switch to the Airplane mode, and make sure that the Instagram's Save Original Photo option is activated.

 Import the photo you'd like to edit to the Instagram app and apply filters or increase contrast or balance on your photo, and then proceed to share the picture. The app will report an error and inform you that the photo cannot be posted to your Instagram account, but the picture you edited will be saved in the photo gallery.

### 9\. Schedule posts in advance

 Social media campaigns depend on punctuality, which is the reason why scheduling Instagram posts is a strategy that might result in a better performance of your account. However, this Instagram tip works only if you have a Business profile on Instagram, and you'll also have to get a social media scheduling tool and a HubSpot software.

 The actual steps you'll need to take in order to schedule a post depend on the social media scheduling tool you are using, so some additional research may be required before you can start scheduling your Instagram posts.

### 10\. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post

 If you want to, you can get notifications for each post from your friends, business associates, and influencers. Turning on notifications on Instagram is easy since all you need to do is go to the Instagram user's profile and select the 'Turn on Post Notifications' options from the Settings menu. The settings icon looks like three black dots, in case you are having trouble finding it.

 However, if you would like this trick to work you must allow Instagram to send you notifications in the first place. Head over to your phone's Settings menu, select the Apps option, locate the Instagram app and choose the feature that enables notifications.

### 11\. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day

 The ephemeral content is becoming more popular every day, but some Instagram Stories deserve more attention than they can get in a single day. If you would like your Instagram Stories to stay online for longer than 24 hours you can create Story Highlights.

 Simply click on the + icon below the profile picture on your Instagram account and select the stories you want to feature in the Story Highlight from the album. The Story Highlights will be visible on your Instagram profile, for as long as you want. Removing or changing the Story Highlights is a simple process that won't take more than five minutes of your time.

### 12\. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts

 A good Instagram account is coherent because Instagrammers interested in fashion have almost zero interest in sports, so if you want to post images that cover both of these topics it is best to create different accounts. Instagram lets its users manage up to 5 interconnected accounts, which opens a plethora of opportunities for big companies that offer more than just one service as well as for up and coming startups that are looking for a big breakthrough in a certain niche.

 If you want to create a new Instagram account, go to Options and tap on the Add New Account feature. You can use the same username and password for all of your Instagram accounts.

### 1\. Download videos and photos in batches

 Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.

[Insta-downloader.net](http://insta-downloader.net/) is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account. You just have to copy the URL of a photo or Instagram profile and click the Download button.

### 2\. Upload photos and videos from your computer

 The Instagram app can't be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and [post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 3\. Repost Instagram photos and videos

 There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn't allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the [Repost app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.

### 4\. Post multiple photos at the same time

 Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.

 The 'Select Multiple' feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.
