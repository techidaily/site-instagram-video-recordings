## Does the video verification work?

No, the video verification does not work optimally in finding fake profiles. The basic concept behind this verification process is scanning the face attributes like the Face ID authorization implemented in the gadgets. The pitfall in this method is that the app recognizes a doll as a real profile by the verification methodology at Instagram. The analysis process requires refinement in sensing the real faces during the account verification procedure at Instagram.

This method fails to ban the fake profiles whereas authorizes all the accounts as safe due to the poor video authentication technique. Instagram must work on this verification process and make sure it gives out the best outcomes efficiently.
