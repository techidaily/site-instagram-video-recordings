TikTok is also one of the biggest social media platforms where users habitually use various tips and tricks to go viral.

So, it would help if you also thought of borrowing some tips and tricks from TikTok to go viral on Instagram Reels.

#### Use trending music and sounds

It is always worth to include trending videos and sounds into the IG Reels. You can select your songs but creating content over trending topics tends to hit the trend among other videos.

![Trendy Music Into Ig Reel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trendy-music-into-ig-reel.jpg)

#### Create your bang

You must grab the user's attention quickly by giving a sort of bang in the initial seconds. Users are swiping up to your video, and if they don't get what they want to see, then IG Reels is a time waste aspect for you. The idea is not to create random stuff but to target the specific users according to your niche so that the videos get noticed and ranked well.

#### Competitor Research

The competitor research is another borrowed feature from TikTok, where you can check out various brands and social media influencers about what they are creating. It’s a great way to find trending hashtags as well.

Keep an eye on your Instagram bio and check if it has the right amount of words and a call to action. You can consider other factors of metrics as the ideal post timing and use of specific hashtags etc.

#### Trigger people to comment on

You can include some random details also so that people get induced to comment on your Instagram Reels. These unexpected details can be anything such as mentioning some weird stuff or writing great captions etc.

#### Be Relatable
