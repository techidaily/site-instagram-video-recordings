### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands. During the lockdown, people all over the world have taken over TikTok to get rid of their boredom. Instagram Reels is practically the same thing as TikTok. The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.
