The real challenge for business owners is, deciding the right type of videos to post! Depending the video format, the specs and dimensions differ which might confuse you.

| |  Video resolution | Minimum width           | Aspect ratio | Max video size | Recommended video formats |         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Facebook            | 1280x720                | 600 pixels   | 16:9/9:16      | 4GB                       | MP4/MOV |
| Instagram           | 600x315/600x600/600x750 | /            | 1.91:1/1:1/4:5 | 4GB                       | MP4/MOV |
