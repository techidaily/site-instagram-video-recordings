## Top Instagram Photo Downloaders for you to save Instagram Photos to your PC or Smartphone

We've split our offerings into three sections to help you find precisely what you need. We'll look at online solutions, browser add-ons which can work as Instagram image downloader tools and smartphone apps which do the same. Enjoy!

* [Part 1: Free online solutions](#part1)
* [Part 2: Browser add-ons](#part2)
* [Part 3: App solutions for your smartphone](#part1)

### Part 1: Instagram Photo/Video Downloader - Free online solutions

#### 1\. **[iGram:](https://igram.io/)**

This web-based Instagram picture downloader can grab all the images associated with a single post. To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click 'Download' and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It's one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.

#### 2\. **[Dredown:](https://www.dredown.com/)**

Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the 'Dredown' button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.

#### 3\. **[blastup:](https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader)**

As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it's a great tool to have in your arsenal.

#### 4\. **[InstaFinsta:](https://instafinsta.com/)**

Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.

#### 5\. **[Inflact:](https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/)**

We love this website as it's not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don't want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It's all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.

Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it's worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.
