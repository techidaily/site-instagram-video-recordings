## Part 4: Instagram Reels VS TikTok

Much like TikTok, Instagram reels are reserved for creating short and engaging videos. Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.

Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don't allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.
