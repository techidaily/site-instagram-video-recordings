You can only access this Instagram analytics tool from your phone, and you won't be able to keep track of posts you shared before you converted to a Facebook Business profile.

#### 4\. [Owlmetrics](https://owlmetrics.com/)

 A quick look at the list of features Owlmetrics provides is enough to explain why this Instagram analytics tool is regarded as one of the most advanced tools on the market.

#### 7\. [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)
