### Final Verdict

We know that you have got a fair idea about using the various Instagram filters to create the most happening Instagram Stories and put your friends in awe. We are sure that the methods mentioned above have made you learn capturing videos in zoom in a quick and easy way. But, it's up to you to decide the best speed while capturing and customizing the video content to make it stand out.

Understanding not only how to zoom in Instagram Stories, but also knowing how to edit it with the right background music will make them more appealing. You need to be a little careful while shooting videos in zoom as the video resolution gets affected and turns shaky. Never mind, beyond all the little restraints, Instagram Stories are the coolest stuff to experiment with, while you curate interesting videos.
