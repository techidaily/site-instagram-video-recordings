Recording handheld high-resolution videos with iPhones and Android Smartphones has been made possible by the rapid advancement of technology. Recording audio, however, is an entirely different matter, because microphones on Smartphone devices often pick up atmospheric noises that completely ruin the audio of a video clip.

Only a couple of years ago, editing the audio of a video clip captured with a Smartphone would require you to transfer the video clip to a computer and then use a video editing software to add music to the video, but in 2018, you can easily add music to the videos you want to post on Instagram by using apps for Android and iPhone devices. If you were looking for an easy way to add music to video clips you've captured with a Smartphone, you've come to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can add music to Instagram videos and stories in just a few simple steps.

Nobody wants to watch video clips with a terrible audio, regardless of how funny or interesting the video is. Luckily, there are a lot of Android and iPhone video editing and sound apps that will enable you to add music of your choosing to videos you post on Instagram. Let's have a look at how you can add a copyright free music to the videos you share with your followers on Instagram.

### Adding Music to Instagram Videos

The built-in apps for video recording on iPhones and Android phones still don't allow its users to edit the audio track of the videos they capture, but the apps below can be used to add the songs you love to the videos you share on your Instagram account

#### 1\. Filmora

Wondershare's Filmora can be downloaded for free from [Google Play](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [App Store](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6). It is equipped with powerful video editing tools that will enable you to trim videos, change their aspect ratio or alter the video playback speed. These video editing options are accompanied by visually impressive video effects, overlays, and transitions.

Filmora features its own music library of licensed songs that can be easily added to Instagram videos. Once you've added the song you want your video, you can export it directly to Instagram from the app. Filmora is easy to use and it will enable you to save time on adding a soundtrack to a video you created.

#### 2\. Videoshop

This free video editor is compatible with iOS and Android operating systems, which makes it a reliable choice for all Instagram videographers, regardless of the device they are using to capture their videos. iPhone users can add songs from their iPod library to the videos they edit with Videoshop app, while both Android and iPhone users can use this app to add sound effects to their Instagram videos.

Videoshop features a lot of powerful video editing tools that will enable you to do anything you want with your videos, including polishing your videos after you add music to them.

#### 3\. VideoSound

This remarkable app costs only $0,99, and the features it offers make it a perfect solution for iPhone owners who want to add music to the videos they want to post on Instagram. The VideoSound app features remarkable sound editing options but lacks even the basic video editing options.

#### 4\. Flipgram

Besides being one of the best apps for video editing for both Android and iPhone devices, Flipgram is also a community of like-minded people where you can find a lot of inspiring content that can motivate you to make remarkable videos.

The app can be used to record videos and edit them, while it also gives you access to its rich royalty-free music library. Sound-activated filters such as Beatbrushes or Vibes will make your Instagram videos more fun to watch and you can also use your selfies to create a video that features the songs you love. Once you explore all the options Flipgram offers, you can share your video to Instagram directly from the app.

#### 5\. VidLab

VidLab is also a superb audio editing tool that allows you to import music from iTunes and add it to a video you want to share on Instagram.

Fading in or fading out music you add to your videos is also an option VidLab offers, and the app grants access to an impressive library of sound effects to its users as well. The VidLab app can be downloaded for free, although it is only available to iPhone users.

### Adding Music to Instagram Stories

The ephemeral content is rising in popularity every day, which is the reason why Instagram Stories are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily routines. As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can't really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.

Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.

### Conclusion

Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch. Let us know in the comments which apps for adding music to Instagram videos you like to use the most and feel free to share this article if you think that your friends should know about these great ways to add music to Instagram stories and videos.
