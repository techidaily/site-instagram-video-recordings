* The second method involves using the Filmora app for mobile devices, a powerful video editing tool for iPhone and Android users. Both methods make it easy to rotate your videos for Instagram and get them ready for sharing on the platform.

#### Q2\. Why Are My Videos Sideways on Instagram?

Videos appearing sideways on Instagram is a common issue that occurs when a video is captured in landscape mode or horizontal orientation instead of portrait mode. When this happens, the video may not fit properly on the screen and appear distorted or sideways when posted on Instagram. This can be frustrating for users who have taken the time to capture a great video but need to share it as intended on the platform.

There are a few reasons why videos may appear sideways on Instagram. One of the most common causes is that the device's orientation was not properly set when the video was captured. Sometimes, videos may also appear sideways due to a glitch in the app or software used to capture the video.

To avoid videos appearing sideways on Instagram, it's important to always capture videos in portrait mode, set the orientation of your device correctly, and edit your videos to ensure they fit properly on the platform.

#### Q3\. What Is the Fastest Way to Rotate a Video on iPhone/Android?

The fastest way to rotate a video on iPhone or Android is to use a third-party app. Several video editing apps are available for iOS and Android devices, but one of the most popular and user-friendly options is Filmora for Mobile. This app is designed specifically for mobile devices and provides a range of features for editing and enhancing your videos.
