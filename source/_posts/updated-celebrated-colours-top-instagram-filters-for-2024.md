* **How do you get different filters on Instagram?**

After you click an image, Instagram takes you to the editing screen, where you can swipe left and right to access the filters.

* **Why can't I find Instagram filters?**

Restart your device, reinstall the Instagram application, clear and cache or free up some RAM if you cannot find filters.

* **How do I search for filters on Instagram?**

Launch the Instagram app and open the camera. Swipe left on the icons located at the bottom of the screen and hit the magnifying glass. Click on any filter and preview it.

* **What filters does famous Instagram use?**

VSCO's A6 for a modern feed, VSCO's S2 for a bright aesthetic look, and VSCO's HB2 for a bold look are some of the famous filters.
