### Section 2: Add a link to main post

 You can add a link to your Instagram post, but the only restraint is, it's not clickable. Unless you pay for it, there is no way you can officially add a link to your Instagram photo.

For this, your account needs to be a business account.

**Step 1** – Go to your Instagram profile and click the 'Settings' tab.
