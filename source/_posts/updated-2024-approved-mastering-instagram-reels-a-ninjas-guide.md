Instagram reels are strikingly similar to TikTok and allow users to create their content by adding music to their videos. These videos can be 15 seconds long, allowing content creators to show their skills in just enough time to catch the user’s attention. You can edit and add effect to these and then post them.

This feature was recently introduced in India, and Instagram downloads went up by 11.4%. However, this feature is still new, and many people are unaware of it. So, we have listed all that you need to know about Instagram Reels and how you can **make Reels on Instagram**. Let’s dive in!

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Make Instagram Reels in 2 Ways

There are two ways to create Instagram reels. You have the option to use the built-in editor or create and edit the video externally and then upload it. Both of these methods are very simple. Let’s have a look.

* [Method 1: How to Make an Instagram Reel With The Built-in Editor](#part1)
* [Method 2: How To Make Reels Using with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](#part2)

#### Method 1: How to Make an Instagram Reel With The Built-in Editor

1\. Open the **Instagram** application and tap on the camera icon in the top left of the screen.

2\. At the bottom of the screen, select **Reels**.

![find reels option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-reels-option2.jpg)

![Instagram Reels Tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg)

4\. Tap the **Record** button to start recording the reel. Tap it again to stop the reel.

5\. As an alternative, you can also set and start the timer for a specified video length.

6\. **Record the video** in one go or divide your 15 seconds into segments and record short clips.

7\. Tap the right arrow once to preview the video. If you are satisfied and content with the result, tap the arrow again to save it.

![preview reels video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-reels-video5.jpg)

8\. Once you are done, tap and open the **Share** page, caption your video and share it.

![share reels on instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-reels-on-instagram.jpg)

If you have a private account compliant with your settings and privacy, the video will only be visible to your followers. Your followers can use neither the original audio nor share it with people who don’t follow you.

If you have a public account, the video will be discoverable by a larger Instagram community. Considering the popularity, it will also stand a chance to land in the **Explore** section, where it can be viewed and shared by millions of other people.

#### Method 2: How To Make Reels Using with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor

Instagram does not limit you to the features embedded in it but allows you to create videos elsewhere and then upload them on Instagram as reels. Wondershare Filmora is one such app that will enable you to create your short videos quickly and easily.
