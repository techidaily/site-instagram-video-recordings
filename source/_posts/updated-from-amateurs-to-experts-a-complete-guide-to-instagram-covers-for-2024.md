## Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?

Want to create Instagram Story Highlights under your bio on your own? Here’s a step-by-step guide to making beautiful IG story highlight covers by using Canva – an easy-to-use online photo editor.

**Step-1: Open Canva & Choose “Your Story”**

Open Canva from your device. On top of the app, you can see all the designs that you can make. Click on “Your story” and it will load templates for your IG stories.

This tutorial breaks down how to design a cover pic for Instagram highlights with an icon and a background color. Let’s start with a blank template.

**Step-2: Pick A Background Color**

Once your blank template loads, follow the below steps:

* Choose a background color for your cover at the bottom of your screen
* Press “+” if you wish to select your own color
* Also, you can type your own color code (it will be great if you can stick to your brand colors)

**Step-3: Add an Icon, Text, Or Emoji**

Now that you have your desired background color, you can add an icon or emoji or text. It’s up to your preferences.

Wondering how to add an icon to your cover? Here’s how you can do it:

* Choose the “+” button on the bottom right corner of the screen
* Choose “Graphics”
* Scroll to discover the graphics they have or you can even search for a particular icon (for example: “heart”)
* Tap on the icon you wish to use for your IG cover
* Select your icon’s color

**Step-4: Add Pages to Design More IG Highlight Covers**

Want to design more Instagram highlights cover pics? You can easily continue to design more covers with Canva.

* Click on the “+” button at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen
* Choose “Pages”

You can design another IG cover with another icon. Simply repeat the process to design more Insta covers.

**Step-5: Save The Covers On Your Phone**

Once you are done with designing cover pics, you can save your Instagram story covers on your phone.

* Click on “Share”
* Choose “Upload to Photos” (Android devices) or “Quick Look (iPhone)
* Tap on the Export icon (bottom left-hand corner of your screen)
* Choose “Save image”

**Step-6: Ensure You Turn On the Instagram Story “Archive”**

Before sharing covers pics on Instagram, make sure you have turned on the “Archive” feature.

* Go to your Instagram settings
* Choose “Story Settings”
* Turn on “Save to archive”

**Step-7: Post On Your Instagram Story**

Your cover images need to be added first in your Insta Stories before you can use them as your covers.

* Share your covers in your Instagram story
* Tap on the “Highlight” button

Next, you have two options to choose from:

1. Create a new IG highlight
2. Add a cover to an existing highlight

In case you already have an existing highlight, choose the one that needs cover.

Here’s how you can create an Instagram Story Highlight:

**Step-8: Create an IG Story Highlight**

* Choose the “+” button
* Give your Highlight a proper name

Your Instagram Story Highlight will be appearing at the bottom of your Instagram Bio.

**Step-9: Edit The Cover**

* Hold your finger pressed on an IG highlight
* Choose “Edit Highlight”
* Choose “Edit Cover”

Now you can change your cover image. Also, you can resize your cover image. For instance, if your icon is very small in the circle, use your fingers to zoom in and make it bigger.

You’re all done!

## Part 4: Tips for Making Your Brand Look Polished

Instagram highlight covers make a fantastic first impression. For businesses of all sizes, IG highlights are a powerful way to display key content and messages and keep it at the top of your IG profile. Wondering about how to design a polished cover photo for Instagram highlights that reflects your brand? Check out a few useful time-saving tips to make your highlights as effective as possible:

#### 1\. Create Insta Highlight Cover Images that Elevate Your Brand Aesthetics

Incorporating the assets of your brand into your cover pics is a great way to make your Story Highlights feel more professional. You need to think about how your brand fonts, colors, as well as design trademarks, can be incorporated into your covers. From bespoke lettering to unique patterns, there are countless opportunities to tap into your brand aesthetics and create a stunning Insta highlight cover photo.

#### 2\. Make Your IG Stories Highlight Covers Descriptive

Beautiful aesthetics may go a long way, but your highlight cover image must act as a visual signpost for the content it contains. A great Instagram Stories Highlight cover will make it very easy for your audience to understand what they will get from viewing the highlight. Descriptive covers encourage more clicks, meaning increased views for your content!

#### 3\. Keep Your Instagram Highlight Covers Cohesive

Once you have landed on your selected cover style, it’s essential to keep your covers cohesive. Therefore, if you have decided to utilize icons for your covers, ensure every highlight cover uses an icon or at least looks great alongside an icon. Keep in mind that a mixture of jarring covers will confuse all your aesthetics and could make your brand seem less professional on Instagram.

### Conclusion

Think about your brand and the Instagram Highlights Covers that will best represent your business, using the above examples as an inspiration. Putting some time and effort into creating beautiful highlight covers can help you boost brand awareness, attract new followers, and drive more views to your Highlights. Time to elevate your brand with the best Insta highlight cover photo!

Anthropologie is one brand that does many things right. So, it’s no surprise that they have nailed their IG Story Highlights, too. What sets them apart from most other businesses are their branded Highlights, such as #AnthroHome and MyAnthro.

With the #AnthroHome Highlight, they do a few things differently. Occasionally, they have styled spaces and visitors can swipe up to directly shop the look. For their #MyAnthro Highlight, they feature fans of Anthropologie and tag their account.

## Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?

Want to create Instagram Story Highlights under your bio on your own? Here’s a step-by-step guide to making beautiful IG story highlight covers by using Canva – an easy-to-use online photo editor.

**Step-1: Open Canva & Choose “Your Story”**

Open Canva from your device. On top of the app, you can see all the designs that you can make. Click on “Your story” and it will load templates for your IG stories.

This tutorial breaks down how to design a cover pic for Instagram highlights with an icon and a background color. Let’s start with a blank template.

**Step-2: Pick A Background Color**

Once your blank template loads, follow the below steps:

* Choose a background color for your cover at the bottom of your screen
* Press “+” if you wish to select your own color
* Also, you can type your own color code (it will be great if you can stick to your brand colors)

**Step-3: Add an Icon, Text, Or Emoji**

Now that you have your desired background color, you can add an icon or emoji or text. It’s up to your preferences.

Wondering how to add an icon to your cover? Here’s how you can do it:

* Choose the “+” button on the bottom right corner of the screen
* Choose “Graphics”
* Scroll to discover the graphics they have or you can even search for a particular icon (for example: “heart”)
* Tap on the icon you wish to use for your IG cover
* Select your icon’s color

**Step-4: Add Pages to Design More IG Highlight Covers**

Want to design more Instagram highlights cover pics? You can easily continue to design more covers with Canva.

* Click on the “+” button at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen
* Choose “Pages”

You can design another IG cover with another icon. Simply repeat the process to design more Insta covers.

**Step-5: Save The Covers On Your Phone**

Once you are done with designing cover pics, you can save your Instagram story covers on your phone.

* Click on “Share”
* Choose “Upload to Photos” (Android devices) or “Quick Look (iPhone)
* Tap on the Export icon (bottom left-hand corner of your screen)
* Choose “Save image”

**Step-6: Ensure You Turn On the Instagram Story “Archive”**

Before sharing covers pics on Instagram, make sure you have turned on the “Archive” feature.

* Go to your Instagram settings
* Choose “Story Settings”
* Turn on “Save to archive”

**Step-7: Post On Your Instagram Story**

Your cover images need to be added first in your Insta Stories before you can use them as your covers.

* Share your covers in your Instagram story
* Tap on the “Highlight” button

Next, you have two options to choose from:

1. Create a new IG highlight
2. Add a cover to an existing highlight

In case you already have an existing highlight, choose the one that needs cover.

Here’s how you can create an Instagram Story Highlight:

**Step-8: Create an IG Story Highlight**

* Choose the “+” button
* Give your Highlight a proper name

Your Instagram Story Highlight will be appearing at the bottom of your Instagram Bio.

**Step-9: Edit The Cover**

* Hold your finger pressed on an IG highlight
* Choose “Edit Highlight”
* Choose “Edit Cover”

Now you can change your cover image. Also, you can resize your cover image. For instance, if your icon is very small in the circle, use your fingers to zoom in and make it bigger.

You’re all done!

## Part 4: Tips for Making Your Brand Look Polished

Instagram highlight covers make a fantastic first impression. For businesses of all sizes, IG highlights are a powerful way to display key content and messages and keep it at the top of your IG profile. Wondering about how to design a polished cover photo for Instagram highlights that reflects your brand? Check out a few useful time-saving tips to make your highlights as effective as possible:

#### 1\. Create Insta Highlight Cover Images that Elevate Your Brand Aesthetics

Incorporating the assets of your brand into your cover pics is a great way to make your Story Highlights feel more professional. You need to think about how your brand fonts, colors, as well as design trademarks, can be incorporated into your covers. From bespoke lettering to unique patterns, there are countless opportunities to tap into your brand aesthetics and create a stunning Insta highlight cover photo.

#### 2\. Make Your IG Stories Highlight Covers Descriptive

Beautiful aesthetics may go a long way, but your highlight cover image must act as a visual signpost for the content it contains. A great Instagram Stories Highlight cover will make it very easy for your audience to understand what they will get from viewing the highlight. Descriptive covers encourage more clicks, meaning increased views for your content!

#### 3\. Keep Your Instagram Highlight Covers Cohesive

Once you have landed on your selected cover style, it’s essential to keep your covers cohesive. Therefore, if you have decided to utilize icons for your covers, ensure every highlight cover uses an icon or at least looks great alongside an icon. Keep in mind that a mixture of jarring covers will confuse all your aesthetics and could make your brand seem less professional on Instagram.
