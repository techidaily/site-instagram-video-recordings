Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.

Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.
