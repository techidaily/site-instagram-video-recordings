### 1\. Kapwing

It's a free online application for editing photos, movies, and GIFs. It does not need registration, so you may begin editing instantly and securely. You have a 250 MB upload limit and may export videos up to 7 minutes in length. Here's your step-by-step guide to **add border to video for Instagram** using Kapwing:

**Step 1**: Select the Start editing on Kapwing's website. It will lead you to the video file upload screen, where you may drag and drop the file or **Click to upload**.

**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.

**Step 3**: When you're happy with the results, go to the top and select **Export Video** to save the video to your computer.

Note: if you want to remove the watermark after exporting, you may need to sign in a new account or sign up.

### 2\. Canva

Canva is a must-have software for anybody who modifies both pictures and videos. It may be accessed from both a smartphone and a computer. Furthermore, the free edition has all of the functionality you'll ever require. Here's your step-by-step guide to add border to video for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1:** Try downloading and _launching_ the **Canva app**, or use the web browser to access it. Then go to **Social media** and pick your preferred film aspect ratio. Here I will choose Instagram Post.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




**Step 2:** Then upload the video to **Canva** to modify it and apply a border. To do so, go to the left pane and choose **Upload media** from the **Uploads** menu. Now navigate to the video's location and post it.

![upload media to canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-media-canva.jpg)

**Step 3:** The clip will appear under the **Videos** section in the **Uploads** category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.

(**Note:** If you'd rather use vibrant colors than plain old white borders, the color tab (top) provides a large color pallet to select from, as shown below).
