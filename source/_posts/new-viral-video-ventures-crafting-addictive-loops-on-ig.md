Simply a click helps you to create a Boomerang and then share it as well.

#### 4.Use Boomerang on Instagram Stories

There are other ways to use the app. You can apply the app through Instagram and make a boomerang from an existing video. Simply open Instagram and swipe left. You can create a video loop by tapping on the infinity symbol. You can also add stickers or filters to the video. It is now a video story, ready for sharing. It is a simpler way of adding the Boomerang effect to your Instagram videos. You can do it through Instagram directly and not have to download any additional applications.

#### 5.Use the New Effects Added

There have been certain effects upgrades added to this app. With the new boomerang video effects, it is even more fun to create videos on Instagram. These are akin to filters and help add on something more to your Boomerang videos:

SlowMo: This is an effect or filter that helps to reduce speed to half. Hence, it helps videos to play slow in either direction.

Echo: This effect is like double vision. It helps content to stand out, similar to adding a motion blur to movements in your video.

Duo: This effect is like rewinding a video clip rapidly to the start. It also gives it a digitized look. It goes well with certain themes and can make your video look creative.

Instagram also allows users to trim the content in such videos. That allows users more flexibility on how they wish to present content. It helps you edit the lengths of Boomerang videos. You can decide which point a video would start and where it would end.

Once you have mastered the basic techniques, use the added effects to make your videos interesting. You can even plan the narrative from before. Once you are familiar with the techniques you can easily add on effects, as per the movements you capture. You can even trim the video clips to make the beginnings and the finishes look aesthetic.

## Quick Solutions: Why Is My Instagram Boomerang Laggy?

You might notice that Instagram has become sluggish on your smartphone. Many people face the problem of slower uploading of feeds. There might be overall sluggish behavior in how the app operates. Often the problem is sorted when you quit and restart the app or your handset.

Another way to do so is to visit Settings and the Apps section in it. Here you should try and clear cache. This will help the app to get back to full functionality. It would also help if you upgraded the application. Update Instagram on your smartphone and restart your device. It should bring back the smoothness of the operation of Instagram on your phone.

## Final Thoughts

You might feel hesitant to try the boomerang effect on a video, especially if you are doing it for the first time. However, remember that there is no need to be perfect with this app. Random use of the app is what makes the videos unique. Once you have tried the app on some videos, you are ready to explore more of its possibilities. If you wish to make an elaborate video plan the narrative from before. Think out the theme and how you wish to capture every clip. If you wish to use it for engaging viewers, you can use the different features to make the videos appealing. You can also take inspiration from others. Checking out other Boomerang videos will give you ideas that can inspire your next video shoot. There are YouTube tutorials that provide step-by-step instructions on how to use the application.

With boomerang effects, there are several creative possibilities to explore. Ensure that you include movement in your video which works out best with the boomerang effect. You can use effects like slow motion, echo, and duo to enhance or emphasize certain actions. If you wish to draw the attention of a certain viewer base, make your videos interesting and unique by employing this app. Effects can be made different from the filters and features that the app offers.
