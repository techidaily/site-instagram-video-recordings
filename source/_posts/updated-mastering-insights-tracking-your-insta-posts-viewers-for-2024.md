Instagram is one of the most popular and widely used social media apps that is mostly used for sharing photos. Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.

Unfortunately, you can't see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn't provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.

There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.

## How to see who viewed your Instagram post using Stories

Does it mean you will never know who viewed your post? Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.

**Step 1:** After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.

![how to check who view your instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg)

**Step 2:** When you tap on 'Your Story', a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded. Now at the bottom left corner, you will number of people who have viewed your story, tap on it.

![methods to check who viewed your Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now you can see the number of people who viewed your story and all those people who have viewed your Instagram story.

![check who viewed your instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step3.jpg)

This is the easiest way of how to see who viewed your Instagram post. But if you are thinking about the images and videos that you post your feed or timeline, then you can see the number of people who viewed your post all those who liked it by following these few simple steps.

## How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes

**Step 1:** Go to any post that you want to track and see how many people have viewed and who liked it. Below your video or image, you can see 'Liked by'. Click on the 'others' next to the name of the person who liked your post.

![use likes to check who viewed your instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png)

**Step 2:** Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.

Since this method doesn't show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn't provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.

![use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png)

## How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?

After knowing that Instagram doesn't provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don't be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn't allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.
