That's why the **Instagram question sticker** has turned out to be a successful venture recently. In the following article, we will show how you can add question stickers to your stories.

## Part 1: Instagram Story Question Sticker: What Is It and How Does It Work?

Instagram released a new fun and exciting feature for customers to engage in in July 2018\. The sticker "Questions" can be applied to your Stories to enable your friends to make submissions. The Instagram Story question sticker is a simple method to engage with your followers by enabling them to express their opinions and preferences with you quickly.

It's accessible to everyone on the official Instagram iOS and Android applications, and it's not only for verified profiles or those with a lot of followers.

#### 1\. The Popularity

Instagram's popularity stems in part from the fact that this is such a communicative tool. You may engage with individuals and companies in various ways, including responding to their postings and sharing their Stories—the best being the Instagram question stickers.

#### 2\. Follower Engagement

One of the best aspects of this function is that it allows your followers to communicate with you privately in a far less intrusive way than direct messages. If you opt to respond to DMs personally, it'll be full of hassle.

#### 3\. Follower Privacy

The answers of your followers are not publicly visible as only you can view them. Their picture and identity will not display when you post one of their replies in a Story.

You may also use other stickers, including the survey sticker or the emoji sliders, to ask any questions.

**But how can you achieve all that? Follow the next part to learn about it!**
