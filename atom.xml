Keep reading for the full product review.</em></p><p> The Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020) is one of a couple options in the second generation of Lenovo’s budget-priced M-series Android tablets. It features an attractive metal body, big 10-inch display, and the option to buy it together with a charging dock that turns it into a sort of smart display.</p><p> The charging dock, unfortunately, isn’t available as a separate purchase, so you have to decide whether or not you want that functionality before buying the device itself. The marquee feature is support for Google Kids Space, which allows parents to essentially child-proof the tablet with thousands of pre-approved games, books, and videos.</p><p> The budget Android tablet market is pretty crowded, but Lenovo did a solid-enough job with the first generation of the M-series that I was interested to see where it would go with the second generation.</p><p> I recently unpacked a second-gen Tab M10 HD and used it for about a week for everything from email and web browsing to video conferencing and streaming movies from<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/overview-of-the-netflix-streaming-service-1847831" >apps like Netflix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hbo-max-how-to-watch-it-4782926" >HBO Max <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . During my time with the tablet, I tested overall performance, video and audio quality, wireless speeds, and a variety of other factors to see if this budget friendly Android tablet is worth the asking price.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-Better-price-better-specs-lower-resolution"><a href="#What’s-New-Better-price-better-specs-lower-resolution" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: Better price, better specs, lower resolution"></a>What’s New: Better price, better specs, lower resolution</h2><p> The first-generation Lenovo Tab M10 hit shelves back in 2019. It shipped with Android 8.1 and an MSRP just shy of $200. Right off the top you can see that Lenovo decided to chase a more budget-friendly market segment with the second generation of the hardware.</p><p> Even with that choice, the second generation includes a processor that’s nearly 10 percent faster, and also more power efficient. The battery is also a bit bigger, and the cameras are slightly better.</p><p> Unfortunately, the second generation Tab M10 received a downgrade in screen resolution. Instead of the full HD 1920 x 1200 resolution offered by the first generation, the second gen Tab M10 has a resolution of only 1280 x 800.</p><h2 id="Design-Attractive-metal-body-and-solid-build-quality"><a href="#Design-Attractive-metal-body-and-solid-build-quality" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive metal body and solid build quality"></a>Design: Attractive metal body and solid build quality</h2><p> The Tab M10 HD looks and feels great for a budget tablet, with solid metal construction and a big 10-inch display. The metal body is a uniform gray color, smooth to the touch, and broken up on the top and bottom with cut-outs that house various inputs and speakers.</p><p> The top includes a speaker grill and a 3.5-millimeter audio input, while the bottom features a second speaker grill and a USB-C input. The right side is where you’ll find the power button, volume rocker, and a drawer that can accept a microSD card along with a SIM card if you pick up a Tab M10 HD that includes the optional feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pPNbzMq7aB9LY-_koMR-oHoTUHA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10HD_02-1cb2ef47999844eaacd3c03a777faea8-f2d25c46eb184b4c8b7a8667735f2ea9.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find Lenovo’s docking port connector. Unfortunately, there’s no way to make use of this connector if you don’t buy the version of the tablet that includes a dock. Lenovo doesn’t provide the dock as an optional accessory to purchase later. This is a bit of a questionable decision on Lenovo’s part, and it’s likely to lead to some consumer disappointment.</p><p> It’s possible that it might work as a charging connector if you bought a second-hand dock, but Lenovo actually ships the two versions of this tablet with different firmware, locking out the extra dock functionality in this version. The bottom line here is that if you want the dock functionality, you need to buy the Smart Tab M10 HD that includes the dock in the box.</p><p> The rear of the tablet is mostly featureless, aside from the aforementioned cut-outs. The single rear-facing camera is located in the upper left corner, and that’s about it. Due to the metal construction, it does look and feel more premium than you’d expect from the price.</p><h2 id="Display-Looks-good-but-the-resolution-could-be-higher"><a href="#Display-Looks-good-but-the-resolution-could-be-higher" class="headerlink" title="Display: Looks good, but the resolution could be higher"></a>Display: Looks good, but the resolution could be higher</h2><p> The 10-inch display is surrounded by fairly slim bezels for a budget Android tablet, offering a screen to body ratio of about 82 percent. The aspect ratio is 16:10, which is pretty close to the standard widescreen ratio of 16:9. It’s a good compromise between being great for media and usable for email and surfing the web.</p><p> While the display is bright and clear, and the colors are nice and vivid, the resolution is a bit on the low side for a screen this big. The first generation of the Tab M10 hardware had a full HD display, while this one gives you only a resolution of 800 x 1280 for an abysmal pixel density of about 149 ppi on the big 10-inch IPS LCD screen. It looks fine when held at arm’s length, but move it any closer and you can make out the individual pixels like you’re looking at the tablet through a screen door.</p><p> While the display is bright and clear, and the colors are nice and vivid, the resolution is a bit on the low side for a screen this big.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn" target="_top" id="2120861">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120861" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Depends-on-the-configuration-you-get"><a href="#Performance-Depends-on-the-configuration-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Depends on the configuration you get"></a>Performance: Depends on the configuration you get</h2><p> The Tab M10 HD (2020) comes equipped with a Mediatek MT6767 Helio P22T processor that’s on the slow side compared to contemporary hardware, but it isn’t bad for a budget Android tablet in this range. You also get your choice of either 32GB of storage paired with 2GB of RAM, or 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM.</p><p> My test unit came equipped with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, and that’s the version I’d recommend targeting. While I wasn’t able to go hands-on with the other configuration, I have tested other tablets with the MT6767 paired with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159" >2GB of RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and found the experience to be less than pleasant. If you do opt for the 2GB version of the hardware, keep in mind that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-benchmark-2625811" >all of my benchmarks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and anecdotal experiences apply only to the 4GB version.</p><p> Overall, I found the second gen Tab M10 HD to be snappy and responsive when navigating menus and launching most apps. I was able to stream media on apps like YouTube and Netflix without issue, browse the internet, write emails, and even hop on a couple Discord calls.</p><p> The hardware isn’t really designed for gaming, and I wasn’t able to install Genshin Impact, which is my favorite go-to game for testing tablets and phones. I did install Asphalt 9 and ran a few races, and it played well enough. I didn’t have any issues nabbing nitro power ups and crossing the finish line ahead of my AI competition. It sounded great, and I never noticed any frame drops or other issues.</p><p> Aside from anecdotal experience, I also ran a handful of benchmarks to get some hard numbers. First up, I downloaded and installed PCMark and ran the Work 2.0 benchmark to test the Tab M10 HD’s chops when it comes to productivity tasks. It scored 4,753 overall in that test, which is OK for a tablet in this price range.</p><p> Overall, I found the second gen Tab M10 HD to be snappy and responsive when navigating menus and launching most apps.</p><p> The score of 3,117 in web browsing was a bit on the low side, while the writing score of 4,508 and data manipulation score of 3,969 were both pretty good. While I didn’t notice any real issues when browsing the web, a score like that suggests you may encounter some slowdown with a bunch of tabs or resource-intensive sites open.</p><p> I also ran a couple graphics benchmarks from GFXBench that test how well you can expect a tablet to run games. The first one I ran was their Car Chase benchmark, which is a game-like benchmark that tests physics, lighting, and other capabilities. It scored a terribly low 3.4 FPS in that test, which is lower than a lot of other devices I’ve looked at in this category. It also scored pretty low in the second benchmark I ran, with a score of just 21 FPS in the T-Rex benchmark.</p><p> These results aren’t very surprising, but they do indicate that you’re unlikely to have that great experience playing complex games on this tablet. If you’re looking for a tablet to run in Google Kids Space, it will run most of those games pretty well. If you’re looking to play anything that’s demanding on a graphics level, keep looking. Even Lenovo’s similarly-equipped Tab M10 FHD Plus performs significantly better in this department.</p><h2 id="Productivity-Best-suited-to-basic-tasks"><a href="#Productivity-Best-suited-to-basic-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Best suited to basic tasks"></a>Productivity: Best suited to basic tasks</h2><p> There are two versions of this tablet: the Tab M10 HD, and the Smart Tab M10 HD. They are identical in terms of both internal hardware and external design. The difference is that the Smart Tab M10 HD comes with a dock, and the Tab M10 HD doesn’t. With its dock and integrated<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> voice controls, the Smart Tab M10 HD gets higher marks in terms of productivity than the Tab M10 HD.</p><p> Taking the dock out of the equation, this hardware isn’t the best for productivity. It’s good for basic tasks like email and browsing the internet, but it isn’t really work-ready. The front-facing webcam will work for video conferencing in a pinch, but it isn’t the best option. This tablet is much better for basic tasks and streaming media than any kind of work usage. It’s also a great option for families with young children, since it includes Google Kids Space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jC-nIsNjG_LVHXw3eP-5D_jO_fY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10HD_03-dad5bfce705b4e0c891a4088b2b77b10.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-stereo-sound-with-support-for-Dolby-Atmos"><a href="#Audio-Decent-stereo-sound-with-support-for-Dolby-Atmos" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent stereo sound with support for Dolby Atmos"></a>Audio: Decent stereo sound with support for Dolby Atmos</h2><p> The Tab M10 HD includes stereo speakers and supports Dolby Atmos. It isn’t the best-sounding tablet I’ve ever listened to, but it sounds great for a device in this price range. I love that the stereo speakers are situated on opposite sides of the tablet, as that makes for a much improved listening experience compared to devices that put both speakers on one side.</p><p> The sound lacks bass and sounds a bit tinny, but that’s to be expected. It’s more than loud enough to fill a room, although I preferred to lower it quite a bit for a more pleasant listening experience. I was actually able to watch movies on Netflix before bed without plugging headphones into the audio jack, as I had no trouble making out dialog, and there wasn’t ever any unpleasant distortion.</p><p> On the subject of audio and headphones, the Tab M10 HD includes a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-fm-radio-on-smartphone-4176272" >built-in FM radio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using your headphones as the antenna. I plugged in my favorite earbuds, loaded up an FM radio app, and I was able to pull down dozens of local FM radio stations with pretty decent reception. This is a feature that isn’t always enabled even when the hardware technically supports it, so it’s a nice little extra you’ll be able to rely on even if your internet goes down.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Good-Wi-Fi-speeds-and-an-LTE-option"><a href="#Network-Good-Wi-Fi-speeds-and-an-LTE-option" class="headerlink" title="Network: Good Wi-Fi speeds and an LTE option"></a>Network: Good Wi-Fi speeds and an LTE option</h2><p> The second gen Tab M10 HD supports dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for wireless networking. As an option, you can also get a version of the hardware that supports GSM, HSPA, and LTE for cellular connectivity. My model was the Wi-Fi only version, so I wasn’t able to check cellular performance.</p><p> I used the Tab M10 HD on my Eero wireless network with a gigabit cable internet connection from Mediacom. At the time of testing, I measured download speeds of 980 Mbps at the modem. To start my tests, I installed the Speed Test app from Ookla and checked the connection speed about three feet from my Eero router.</p><p> The biggest news here is that the second gen Tab M10 HD comes with Google Kids Space, which is a great app if you have kids, as it allows you to transform the tablet into a kid-friendly spigot of entertainment.</p><p> At a distance of about 3 feet from the router, the Tab M10 HD registered a top download speed of 246 Mbps and an upload speed of 69.1 Mbps. That’s more or less in line with what I’m used to seeing from budget-priced Android hardware on this network, but I’ve seen speeds in excess of 440 Mbps from more expensive devices.</p><p> After establishing that baseline, I took the Tab M10 HD around the corner into a hallway about 10 feet from the router. At that distance, the connection speed dropped just a bit to 230 Mbps. Next up, I took the tablet into another room, about 60 feet from the router, with walls and other obstructions in the way. It held pretty strong, with a download speed of 230 Mbps.</p><p> Finally, I took it out into my garage, about 100 feet from the modem, and the speed dropped to 76.4 Mbps. That’s pretty solid performance, and lines up with my experience of being able to stream media wherever I tried anywhere in my house.</p><h2 id="Camera-Decent-enough-for-a-budget-tablet"><a href="#Camera-Decent-enough-for-a-budget-tablet" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Decent enough for a budget tablet"></a>Camera: Decent enough for a budget tablet</h2><p> Lenovo improved the camera situation in the 2020 version of the Tab M10 HD compared to the first generation, but not enough to provide anything even close to what I’d consider good results. The rear camera is an 8MP shooter that can record 1080p video at 30 FPS, and it also has a 5MP sensor around front for a selfie cam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QWjGqm3tIOfUaMl-XbAiyNGq3Qs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10HD_04-1ce5df00874d43509815a19be12088ad-889e4f6f68c041b58b9e2d96cd0d9c29.jpg"                      alt=" Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115920/19272" target="_top" id="2115920">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115920" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115920/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> Photos taken with the rear camera are more or less what I’ve come to expect from devices in this price class. Colors tend to look washed out, and uneven light results in parts of a photo being blown out. In anything less than full daylight outdoors, I noticed a whole lot of noise as well.</p><p> The front camera is even worse, and you probably won’t be uploading any selfies taken with this tablet to your Instagram. I found it to work fine for video calls, but my face was always washed out or blown out depending on the lighting conditions.</p><h2 id="Battery-Could-be-bigger"><a href="#Battery-Could-be-bigger" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Could be bigger"></a>Battery: Could be bigger</h2><p> The Tab M10 HD features a 5,000 mAh battery that provides decent battery life, but it could definitely be bigger. I’ve tested a lot of mid-range phones that manage to pack a 5,000 mAh battery into significantly smaller packages, and a battery that’s great for a small-screened phone just doesn’t stretch as far when it’s powering a 10-inch display. I found myself throwing the tablet on its charger every day, although you could probably squeeze two days of lighter use out of it.</p><p> To test the battery, I set the screen brightness to the highest level and played HD videos on YouTube on an infinite loop. In that state, the Tab M10 HD lasted a little over six hours. That’s less than half the run time I’ve seen from phones with this size battery, so this is definitely an area where Lenovo could improve if they take a third pass on the hardware.</p><p> While this isn’t an all-day battery, and you’ll probably have to stick it on the charger every day, six hours is long enough to catch up on your favorite show in bed at night, or keep the kids entertained in the car during a long drive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135358/19272" target="_top" id="2135358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135358/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Stock-Android-10-and-Google-Kids-Space"><a href="#Software-Stock-Android-10-and-Google-Kids-Space" class="headerlink" title="Software: Stock Android 10 and Google Kids Space"></a>Software: Stock Android 10 and Google Kids Space</h2><p> Lenovo doesn’t mess around with stock Android too much, and the Tab M10 HD ships with a very clean, very stock Android 10 experience. It works exactly like you’d expect a stock Android 10 device to work, with the extra apps it forces on you being only the Lenovo Tips app, an FM radio app, and Dolby Atmos.</p><p> The biggest news here is that the second gen Tab M10 HD comes with Google Kids Space, which is a great app if you have kids, as it allows you to transform the tablet into a kid-friendly spigot of entertainment. It includes tons of pre-approved apps, books, and videos so you don’t have to worry about curating age-appropriate content. It also integrates with the Google Family Link app, providing you with remote control over screen time limits, bed times, and more.</p><h2 id="Price-Hits-the-right-price-point-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Hits-the-right-price-point-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Hits the right price point for what you get"></a>Price: Hits the right price point for what you get</h2><p> With an MSRP of $129.99 for the 2GB version and $169.99 for the 4GB version, the Lenovo Tab HD (2020) hits the sweet spot for a mid-range Android tablet like this. While I strongly recommend the 4GB version, the 2GB version is a great deal at just $129.99, especially as a childrens’ tablet. If you’re looking for a family tablet that your kids can use, this version is a great option that’s definitely priced right. The 4GB version is a bit pricey, but the extra RAM helps enough that I have trouble saying it’s actually overpriced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tEVLeulE6MYWbsBkYCv9cDXD3CM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lenovo_TabM10HD_05-ffe07c01135a491abdafbdc41ef6eca6.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Lenovo-Tab-M10-HD-2020-vs-Lenovo-Tab-M10-FHD-Plus-2020"><a href="#Lenovo-Tab-M10-HD-2020-vs-Lenovo-Tab-M10-FHD-Plus-2020" class="headerlink" title="Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020) vs. Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)"></a>Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020) vs. Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020)</h2><p> Lenovo released two versions of the M-series tablet in 2020: the Tab M10 HD and the Tab M10 FHD Plus. These tablets look identical at first glance, with the Tab M10 FHD Plus being just a hair bigger, and they have fairly similar specifications. They’re the same color, have the same button configuration, and the cases look almost identical. The Tab M10 FHD Plus benchmarks a little better for some reason despite having the same processor, but I didn’t notice any difference in performance.</p><p> The Tab M10 FHD Plus has a slightly bigger display, and its IPS LCD panel sports a full HD resolution of 1920 x 1200. The result is that the display looks a whole lot better on the Tab M10 FHD Plus, making it a lot easier on the eyes when watching videos.</p><p> The other big difference is that the more expensive configuration of the Tab M10 HD has an MSRP of $169.99, while the Tab M10 FHD Plus has an MSRP of $209.99. If you don’t mind the lower resolution, or you’re primarily looking for a tablet for your kids, then the Tab M10 HD can save you some money without really sacrificing on performance. The Tab M10 FHD Plus has a far superior display, though.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great for casual use or as a tablet for the kids.</strong></p><p> The Lenovo Tab M10 HD (2020) looks great and feels solid, and the price is right. If you’re looking for a tablet that you’ll primarily use for email and web browsing, with some video streaming thrown in, it’s a very solid option. Thanks to the inclusion of Google Kids Space, it’s also a great choice if you’re looking for a tablet for your kids.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-p11-pro-review-5116910" >Lenovo P11 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-review-5088997" >Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pixel-slate-review-a-chromeos-mess-5072398" >Google Pixel Slate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Tab M10 HD (2nd Gen)</li><li>Product Brand  Lenovo</li><li>MPN  ZA6W0175US</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  0.92 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.51 x 5.88 x 0.33 in.</li><li>Color  Iron Grey, Platinum Grey</li><li>Price  $129.99 - $169.99 ($169.99 as configured)</li><li>Warranty  13 months limited</li><li>Platform  Android 10</li><li>Processor  Octa-core Mediatek MT6762 Helio P22T</li><li>RAM  2GB &#x2F;

Many people are trying to become influencers on Instagram daily. To do that, they have to keep the check on their followers’ counts. No one wants their follower count to decrease. But if that happens, then you would like to know who has unfollowed you. There are many ways to check it, but the most basic form of how to see who unfollowed you on Instagram is by inspecting manually. The following steps can assist you in that:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the app</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to launch the Instagram app or website on your phone or on a computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the following</strong></p><p>Now, look at the following box in the profile of the person you want to check manually. If you don’t see your profile in the <strong>Following tab</strong>, then you can assume that they have unfollowed you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-following-list.jpg"                      alt="Instagram following list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Search the name</strong></p><p>Go to the <strong>Search bar</strong> and search the person by that person’s username. This will tell whether the person is following you or not as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-instagram-following-list.jpg"                      alt="search in Instagram following list"                ></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><p>You don’t need any third-party app to know who unfollowed you. So, it is not much complicated.</p><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><p>if your followers are in thousands, it is pretty hectic to go to each person’s profile to check that. So this way is quite time-consuming.</p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-See-Who-Unfollowed-You-on-Instagram-2021with-NO-APPS-100-Safe-Method"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-See-Who-Unfollowed-You-on-Instagram-2021with-NO-APPS-100-Safe-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to See Who Unfollowed You on Instagram 2021with NO APPS [ 100% Safe Method]"></a>Part 2: How to See Who Unfollowed You on Instagram 2021with NO APPS [ 100% Safe Method]</h2><p>Many of you are not aware of a third-party app-free method that is quick, reliable, and safe. But now, you don’t have to worry about it because we will cover a 100% secure way of how to know who unfollowed you on Instagram. The following steps can help you in understanding that method:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Security</strong></p><p>Open the Instagram app and go to <strong>Profile.</strong> You need to select the <strong>three horizontal dots</strong> at the top right corner of the screen, tap on <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Security</strong> from that list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-security-option.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Security Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Download Data and Information from Instagram</strong></p><p>Now, you have to tap on <strong>Download Data</strong> from the panel, and a confirmation window will appear, tap on Download Data again. Instagram will email a copy of your data to you in about 48 hours. You need to download the data from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-instagram-information.jpg"                      alt="download Instagram information"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Copy followers and Following list</strong></p><p><strong>Unzip</strong> the file you have downloaded.

These apps work as Third-party apps to keep track of people following you and the people who have unfollowed you.

The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:</p><ul><li><strong>Going Live</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Active</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there’s a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with audience</strong></li></ul><p>Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers.

But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.</p><h4 id="3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts"><a href="#3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts" class="headerlink" title="3.

The only solution to this issue is to crop the video and change its aspect ratio so it fits one of the commonly used aspect ratios on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download Filmora and Import the file into the software</strong></p><p>In order to start cropping your videos, you first must install the Filmora video editing software on your computer. Open the video editor in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, and then click on the Import drop-down menu and select the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Drag and Drop the video file onto the Timeline</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Now that the video clip you want to edit is in the editor’s media library, drag it and drop it to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop videos for Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>1. Landscape (16:9)</strong></p><p>Chances are that the camera you used to record your video clip recorded the footage in the landscape aspect ratio. Before you can export your video clip, you must first check the resolution and frame rate of the clip you want to export. Right-click on the clip in the media panel and select Properties. After you found out this information, click on the Export button located just below the media panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="check aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Once the new window appears, you should click on the Format icon positioned in the upper left corner of the screen. Select the MP4 format, name your file and select the folder where the file will be exported.</p><p>Click on the Settings button and then set the Quality of the video to Best and select the HD Optimized option in the Encoder menu. Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio. Once you made the calculations return to Filmora and click on the Manually option in the Crop and Pan screen. Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-trends-essential-hashtags-for-todays-influencers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Trends Essential Hashtags for Today's Influencers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-segmentviewpoint-report/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved SegmentViewpoint Report</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-for-capturing-instagram-vids-pcmac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate List for Capturing Instagram Vids (PC/Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-understanding-instagrams-privacy-controls/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Understanding Instagram's Privacy Controls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/15-best-strongest-pokemon-to-use-in-pokemon-go-pvp-leagues-for-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>15 Best Strongest Pokémon To Use in Pokémon GO PvP Leagues For Realme C53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/best-7-artificial-intelligence-powered-voice-synthesizers-compatible-with-pcs-iphones-and-android-devices/"><u>Best 7 Artificial Intelligence-Powered Voice Synthesizers Compatible with PCs, iPhones & Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/best-free-apple-iphone-12-mini-imei-checker-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Best Free Apple iPhone 12 mini IMEI Checker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ing-impressive-3d-beginnings-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Creating Impressive 3D Beginnings on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/diagnose-and-fix-razer-barracuda-x-laptop-mic-problems-under-windows-1011-step-by-step-tutorial/"><u>Diagnose & Fix Razer Barracuda X Laptop Mic Problems Under Windows 10/11 - Step-by-Step Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/how-to-install-epson-v600-driver-step-by-step-guide-with-download-links/"><u>How to Install Epson V600 Driver: Step-by-Step Guide with Download Links</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-lock-screen-settings-how-to-enable-and-disable-on-nokia-c110-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Lock Screen Settings How to Enable and Disable on Nokia C110</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-global-audiences-top-video-language-converters-for-2024/"><u>New Unlocking Global Audiences Top Video Language Converters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-essential-blueprint-crafting-memes-that-perform-on-social-networks-for-2024/"><u>The Essential Blueprint Crafting Memes That Perform on Social Networks for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastermind-Your-Marketing-Surge-to-1-000-Insta-Supporters-Each-Month"><a href="#Mastermind-Your-Marketing-Surge-to-1-000-Insta-Supporters-Each-Month" class="headerlink" title="Mastermind Your Marketing: Surge to 1,000 Insta Supporters Each Month"></a>Mastermind Your Marketing: Surge to 1,000 Insta Supporters Each Month</h2><p>If you want to be a successful Instagrammer, you need to have many followers. But don’t worry – you don’t have to resort to shady tactics to get more followers. There are several things you can do that are both easy and effective.</p><p>This post will outline 12 of the best ways to get 1,000 followers every month on Instagram.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram"></a>How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram</h2><ol><li>Establish a Strong Social Media Presence.</li><li>Optimize Your Profile.</li><li>Know your audience.</li><li>Post at the right time of day.</li><li>Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</li><li>Engage with Other Users</li><li>Post-User-Generated Content</li><li>Collaborate with Influencers</li><li>Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</li><li>Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</li><li>Tag Brands in Your Posts</li><li>Follow the Right People</li></ol><p>So read on and start growing your following today!</p><p><strong>#1. Establish a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg"                      alt="establish a strong social media presence"                ></p><p>To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you’re posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.</p><p>But it’s not just about quantity – it’s also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers’ lives. If you can do all of that, you’ll be on your way to social media success.</p><p><strong>#2. Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6. Engage with Other Users</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg"                      alt="engage with other users"                ></p><p>You can’t just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers’ posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other’s content).</p><p><strong>#7. Post-User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg"                      alt="post-user-generated content"                ></p><p>Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don’t forget to thank them for the shoutout!</p><p><strong>#8. Collaborate with Influencers</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg"                      alt="collaborate with influencers"                ></p><p>Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.</p><p><strong>#9. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg"                      alt="share your instagram profile on other platforms"                ></p><p>Don’t forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.</p><p><strong>#10. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of instagram stories"                ></p><p>Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&amp;As with followers. And don’t forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.</p><p><strong>#11. Tag Brands in Your Posts</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg"                      alt="tag brands in your post"                ></p><p>If using products from a specific brand, don’t forget to tag them in your Instagram posts. This not only helps increase visibility for both parties, but it can also result in potential collaborations.</p><p><strong>#12. Follow the Right People</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-12.jpg"                      alt="follow the right people"                ></p><p>Follow Instagrammers in the same industry as you who post content relevant to your brand or business. This can help drive more traffic to your profile and potentially result in new followers.</p><h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>The takeaway from this article is to understand how to use the Instagram algorithm and how it works. So, what are the main points you should take away from this?</p><ul><li>The Instagram algorithm is an important concept for all brands to understand. It’s going to help you make better content and improve your engagement.</li><li>Use hashtags sparingly to avoid getting shadow banned by Instagram. Make sure that your hashtags are relevant, but don’t go overboard, as it will annoy users who might be searching for those terms.</li><li>Engagement with other users on Instagram can help grow your account much faster than simply posting pictures or videos of products alone since other users will see them in their feeds and potentially interact with them via likes, comments, or even following your account if they find it interesting enough!</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you consistently gain 1,000 followers on Instagram every month, your account will grow significantly in terms of followers.

While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1. Grum"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.grum.co/" >Grum <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Planning and scheduling your posts in advance is a great way to carry out your social media advertising campaign. Grum is the perfect tool that will enable social media managers to save time on posting content to Instagram accounts they are managing because they can schedule weekly posts.</p><p>The platform lets you upload videos and photos to your Grum account, and you can easily schedule your next post by clicking on the Schedule icon. A three-day trial is available if you want to test Grum before deciding which pricing plan best fits your needs.</p><h4 id="2-Planoly"><a href="#2-Planoly" class="headerlink" title="2. Planoly"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.planoly.com/" >Planoly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you take your social media posts seriously, then a tool as powerful as Planoly will certainly help you with developing your Instagram accounts. The platform offers several different pricing options that start from $7 a month for a single account, while teams that need to manage as many as ten accounts can easily do so for $199 per month.</p><p>Uploading and scheduling content is fast and easy, which means that you can schedule posts months in advance. Planoly’s ‘Analyze’ option will also help you to get a better picture of your audience since it can help you increase user engagement and sales of your products.</p><h4 id="3-Buffergram"><a href="#3-Buffergram" class="headerlink" title="3. Buffergram"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://buffergram.com/" >Buffergram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Unlike many other companies that just provide scheduling services, Buffergram actually posts your content to Instagram. This platform is aimed at high-end professionals who can’t afford a second-rate service, which is why it also tells you how well your posts are performing on Instagram. Furthermore, their Agency package allows you to handle several Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><p>People who choose to utilize Buffergram’s services can choose who many posts per day they want, so a post a day will cost you just $5 dollars a month while 5 daily posts cost $20 per month. Packages that include tracking services are also available.</p><h4 id="4-Onlypult"><a href="#4-Onlypult" class="headerlink" title="4. Onlypult"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://onlypult.com/" >Onlypult <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is an easy to use and cost-effective tool that automatically posts scheduled photos and videos to your Instagram account. What’s more Onlypult stores your hashtags, which means that you can easily add hashtags you already used to new posts. During the scheduling process, you can upload as many photos and videos as you want and you can also apply filters, select the aspect ratio or add captions.</p><p>For $55 a month you can manage 40 Instagram accounts and post an unlimited number of posts to each of these accounts, which is the reason why Onlypult is the perfect tool for your Instagram marketing campaign.</p><h4 id="5-Gramblr"><a href="#5-Gramblr" class="headerlink" title="5. Gramblr"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://gramblr.en.softonic.com/" >Gramblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This desktop app enables you to post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop. Gramblr doesn’t offer scheduling services, but it is so easy to use that most digital marketers will have to think twice before choosing to use some other option for uploading content to Instagram. Gramblr is available for both Mac and Windows OS and it offers more than 50 filters. In addition, you can add captions in any language, while you can also keep track of the basic analytics.</p><p>You can download Gramblr for free, but despite its advantages, this app lacks more advanced option that makes posting to Instagram much easier.</p><h4 id="6-Later"><a href="#6-Later" class="headerlink" title="6. Later"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/" >Later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The fact that some of the most famous brands in the world use the services Latter provides shows that this one of the best platforms for scheduling and posting videos on Instagram. Furthermore, individuals can use Latter for free as long as they want, while agencies and large marketing teams can manage up to five accounts per platform for only $49 per month.</p><p>Latter gives you access to advanced analytics that can be essential to your online marketing strategy and it allows you to upload content from your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p><h4 id="7-Schedugr"><a href="#7-Schedugr" class="headerlink" title="7. Schedugr"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://schedugr.am/" >Schedugr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is probably one of the most convenient tools for uploading photos and videos to Instagram because all uploads are automatic. You can crop, add filters and text or rotate images, while you can also post immediately or schedule a post. ScheduGram’s users can manage several accounts at the same time and save a significant amount of time by scheduling posts months in advance.</p><p>The pricing plans are based on the number of accounts you are managing with this tool, which means that you’ll have to pay $20 per month to manage a single account with ScheduGram.

This is because Instagram suffers with chronic content overload. More than <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/" >95 million photos and videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are shared on the platform every day, which means that your posts can easily disappear into the ether.</p><p> So, what does it take to go from insta-average to gram greatness?

In fact, once you know what you’re doing, you’ll be able to crank every single visual you post into top gear, with just a few taps here and there. Here are some top tips on how to edit Instagram photos to help you post like a true pro.</p><ul><li><strong>Take a great photo to begin with</strong></li></ul><p> It’s a bit of a no-brainer, but if your photograph sucks from the get-go, none of the Instagram photo editor apps will fix your mess for you. Take heed of our photography tips and begin with an awesome shot before you’ve even started to fiddle with the software.</p><ul><li><strong>Upload like a pro</strong></li></ul><p> Hopefully you’re comfortable with uploading images to Instagram, but if you’re still in the dark, here’s how to do it. Open the Instagram app on your device and click the plus sign to upload an image. You’ll find this in the bottom of your screen front and centre. From here, simply click the photo you’d like to upload from your camera roll.</p><p> When you upload, Instagram automatically crops your image to their signature square format. However, if you haven’t decided how you want to crop your photo or would prefer it at its original width, you can simply click the expand icon in the left corner to take it back to full size. You can upload one image, or up to 10 photos at once, so don’t be shy!</p><ul><li><strong>Select your filter</strong></li></ul><p> Now you can start to really have some fun! The built in Instagram photo editor app is a pretty powerful little tool, and there’s loads of tweaks and edits you can make to step your photo sharing up a notch. The first thing to do is choose one of the many awesome filters which are built into the Instagram app.</p><p> There’s no hard and fast rule about which filter looks best; it really comes down to personal taste. However, it’s worth thinking about what you want to achieve, and go for a filter that creates the right type of atmosphere for your scene. Here are some of the most popular Instagram filters, and how each one will change your image:</p><ul><li><strong>X Pro II:</strong> One of our favorites, this one sharpens, adds contrast and a vignette edge, to give photos a dramatic, professional effect. This one is a particularly good choice for modern photos of people</li><li><strong>Moon:</strong> If you love black and white photography, this filter is a great choice. Shadows are more intense, highlights seem to pop and the soft focusing gives a nicely aged look to the images.</li><li><strong>Lo-Fi:</strong> Another favorite over here, Lo-Fi saturates your image with rich colors and darkens all the shadows to add drama and intrigue.</li><li><strong>Hefe:</strong> If you love the vintage look, Hefe will be a great choice. It adds a yellow tone and darker border for an edgy, aged appearance to your shots.</li><li><strong>Valencia:</strong> Hefe not aged enough for you? Try out Valencia. The addition of warm tones and faded colors will give your images an antique look, perfect for Insta-greatness.</li></ul><p> There are plenty of other filters to play with, so have a tinker and see which ones you like best. You may find that different filters suit different types of shots, or that you prefer to use the same one or two to give your Instagram feed a uniform style that is all your own.</p><p> To help you refine your photos with the same filters regularly, you can reorder the filter options on the Instagram photo editor app itself. Simply press and hold the three grey lines on the filter you want to move, then slide it into the position you wish. You can also hide filters entirely from the ‘manage’ functions of the menu, so that you don’t keep being offered a filter you really don’t like.</p><ul><li><strong>Add a touch of lux</strong></li></ul><p> Have you ever noticed the lux function on Instagram? If you want to know how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, then this is one feature you really need to get to know intimately. It’s super easy to use, but perhaps you’ve never found it. Well, let us welcome you to the world of better photos.</p><p> When you’re still on the filter selection screen, do you see that little sunshine-like symbol at the top? Hit that, and then fiddle with the slider to add more of less lux to your image. This tool automatically tweaks the saturation and contrast, adding vibrancy to your photos and highlighting the small details that make a good photo great. Slide up for more or down for less and learn to love the lux touch!</p><ul><li><strong>Do some basic editing</strong></li></ul><p> Within the Instagram photo editor app, aside of the filters there are also some tools for the most basic of manual image editing. It’s well worth becoming adept at these, because on your quest to discover how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, these handy functions really do separate the men from the boys. Here’s how they work:</p><ul><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Also know as the ‘straighten my shot’ tool this is crucial if, like so many of us, you’re incapable of taking a photo completely straight. Find something perfectly horizontal or vertical, and line it up with the handy guides within the tool.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Shots a bit shady? This can add a touch of sunlight and brightness to any image, very useful for those taken in poor lighting or at night.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> When everything is somewhat wishy-washy, contrast will adjust the difference in light balance to add more variation between light and shadow. Alternatively, if your image is a bit over exposed, less contrast can tone things down a bit.</li><li><strong>Structure:</strong> When you want to pick out those little details, structure will help add texture to your image. Great for landscapes and nature photos but not so great on portraits.</li><li><strong>Warmth:</strong> Adjusting the tones on your images can make things more dramatic, friendlier, or more edgy. Sliding the tool to the right will add sepia and orange tones, perfect for a sunset or holiday shot, whereas to the left will make things cooler and more blue-ish.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Adjusting the saturation can make the colors in your photos more vibrant but be cautious in its use as it can make photos look totally over-edited. Slide the adjuster completely to the left to turn your image black and white.</li><li><strong>Fade:</strong> As you might guess, fade makes your picture look faded. It’s great for manually adding a vintage feel to your photos if the built-in filters just aren’t doing it for you.</li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Make whites whiter and brights brighter by adjusting this setting up or move it down to tone down highlights that are just too poppy.</li><li><strong>Shadow:</strong> As the alter-ego to highlights, you can already guess what this tool does. Use it to add drama by darkening shadows in your image, or make previously unseen details reappear by reducing the depth of the dark areas.</li><li><strong>Color:</strong> Add a tint to your photos of your choice of color and choose whether to apply it to the shadows or highlights of the image.</li><li><strong>Vignette:</strong> Love the attention focusing abilities of dark edges around your subject? Vignette adds this automatically, and you can adjust the intensity of this effect with ease.</li><li><strong>Tilt shift:</strong> If you want something in the foreground in focus and everything else out of focus, this is the tool that imitates what only the most expensive cameras can do. Choose a circular shift to pick out a particular object, or a linear shift to focus everything at a certain depth in the photo.</li><li><strong>Sharpen:</strong> To make your images super clear, sharpen is a great tool. Unlike Structure it doesn’t add extra detail, it simply enhances the details that were already there for a clearer, more professional image.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve finished editing your image, you’re all ready to post it. Don’t forget to make the most of hashtags and an interesting caption to help other users find your photos and consider tagging your location to get even more likes and followers.</p><p> So now you know how to edit Instagram photos on the Instagram photo editor app. You don’t always have to post your photos to Instagram either. Simply turn on your airplane mode and the app will allow you to save your photos locally, letting you make use of all the funky tools available without having to share your images directly.</p><p> Do remember that Instagram images are 1080 x 1080 pixels when they are uploaded. You might not realise this as they are certainly a lot smaller when you view them. Instagram itself resizes each image to 612 x 612 pixels, but when it’s displayed in a user’s feed, it’s even smaller again, at just 510 x 510.</p><p> What this means for you is that, although the picture displayed is small, any distortion caused by expansion of a small image in the first place will be replicated even at smaller sizes. When it comes to insta-worthy images, quality is king, so never be tempted to share anything that is any less than 1080 x 1080 pixels. If you’ve got smaller pictures that you are itching to share, do so via other social media platforms.</p><p> How is your Instagram photo editing going?

To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps.

Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115931/19272" target="_top" id="2115931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5.

Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories.

Finally, the users of one of the largest social networks ever created can post videos that last longer than sixty seconds, although there are a number of limitations. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Uploading a video to Instagram TV, or IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a straightforward process, but at the moment you can only add vertically oriented videos to your IGTV channel. That’s why we’ve decided to show you several quick and easy ways of resizing and rotating your videos so that each video you share on IGTV fits the platform’s demands perfectly.</p><h3 id="Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine"><a href="#Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine" class="headerlink" title="Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine"></a>Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine</h3><p>Recently, video marketing has become an unstoppable trend. Celebrities and businesses earn great fortune through high-quality marketing videos. To join the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >profitable video marketing era <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can create your own IGTV marketing videos now!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-marketing-videos.png"                      alt="create marketing videos"                ></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos?

[PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]"></a>Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos? [PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]</h2><p>At the moment, IGTV only supports videos with aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 to 9:16</strong>, so if you recorded a video in any other aspect ratio you will have to change it before you share it on your IGTV channel. Moreover, the maximum size of a video file that lasts up to ten minutes is limited to just <strong>650MB</strong>, and the chances are that you will have to change the file’s size in order to be able to upload it to IGTV. Let’s have a look at some of the most effective ways of reformatting your IGTV videos.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers"><a href="#Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers"></a>Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers</h4><p>Changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of a video file in Filmora is easy. After you launch Wondershare’s video editor, you’ll have the option to <strong>create a new project</strong> or continue working on a project you already created. Once Filmora’s main window appears on the screen you just have to go to the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.</p><p>You can then change the resolution or choose a different frame rate. It is best to pick the <strong>1080X1920 (9:16 Portrait) option</strong> since the files exported in 2160X3840 (9:16 Portrait) resolution can end up being too large for the IGTV platform. Click on the OK button to confirm the adjustments you’ve made, and proceed to edit your video.</p><p>In case the process of changing a video’s aspect ratio and resolution is too complicated for you, Filmora offers an even simpler way of reformatting footage. Simply <strong>import a video</strong> into the video editor, and then <strong>place it on a video track on the timeline</strong>. <strong>Right-click on the file</strong> and select the <strong>Crop and Zoom option</strong> from the menu, or alternatively, just use the left mouse click to select a video you added to the timeline and use the <strong>Alt+C keyboard shortcut</strong> to access the <strong>Crop and Zoom window</strong>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ratio drop-down menu</strong> and choose the <strong>9:16 option</strong>, and then <strong>position the Crop rectangle over the area of the video you’d like to keep</strong>. Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.</p><p> We’ve gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let’s start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.</p><h2 id="Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas"><a href="#Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas"></a>Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas</h2><p> Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.</p><ul><li><strong>Cityscapes and Landscapes</strong></li></ul><p> There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don’t feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-convert-your-best-videography-into-melodic-mp3s-insta/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Convert Your Best Videography Into Melodic MP3s (Insta)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximize-impact-video-resizing-techniques-for-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximize Impact Video Resizing Techniques for Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-inside-perspectives-unveiling-what-you-dont-know-about-story-watching/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Inside Perspectives Unveiling What You Don't Know About Story Watching</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prelude-to-cinematic-dialogue/"><u>2024 Approved Prelude to Cinematic Dialogue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/resolving-mfc42dll-file-not-found-issues-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Resolving mfc42.dll File Not Found Issues: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/smart-home-showdown-alexa-versus-google-assistant-for-personalized-performance/"><u>Smart Home Showdown: Alexa Versus Google Assistant for Personalized Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/your-ultimate-guide-to-accessing-facebook-content-on-applemedia-hub-for-2024/"><u>Your Ultimate Guide to Accessing Facebook Content on AppleMedia Hub for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>
