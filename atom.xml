To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. Inflact:"></a>5. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/" >Inflact: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools. Here are five of the best ones out there for you to try.</p><h4 id="1-IG-Downloader"><a href="#1-IG-Downloader" class="headerlink" title="1.

With a click of the button, you can save live streams, stories, highlights and any individual post directly to your Google Drive. It works with Chrome and is a free extension in the store.</p><h4 id="2-Downloader-for-Instagram"><a href="#2-Downloader-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloader for Instagram:"></a>2. <strong>Downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>This Instagram photo downloader for Chrome claims to be the world’s easiest browser extension to download images and videos from Instagram. It supports stories downloads and mass downloads with one click, and also lets you upload photos from your PC too. It’s free, but right now it doesn’t allow video uploads from your PC, although the developers say they are working on that.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Video-Download"><a href="#3-Instagram-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="3. Instagram Video Download:"></a>3. <strong>Instagram Video Download:</strong></h4><p>If you’re more of a Firefox person, Instagram Video Download has got you covered.

Video Downloader Professional for Edge:"></a>4. <strong>Video Downloader Professional for Edge:</strong></h4><p>For those who are browsing with Microsoft’s own products, this Instagram video downloader add on is the app you need. It only works with video at the moment, but you can use it on Vimeo and YouTube as well, and of course it’s free.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram-Downloader"><a href="#5-Instagram-Downloader" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram Downloader:"></a>5. <strong>Instagram Downloader:</strong></h4><p>With a hugely loyal following, Opera remains one of the world’s biggest browsers, so we had to include an offering for these guys too. This app to save Instagram videos and images lets you download all images or videos from a particular profile at once, as well as adding a button to individual photos and videos to enable single item downloading too.</p><p>Whichever browser floats your boat, these browser add-ons make Instagram image downloading super simple.

You can get the full profile details from Instagram, and there’s no log in required to use it.

Downloader for Instagram:"></a>5. <strong>Downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>Another app to save Instagram videos and photos who could have done with a better copywriter at the time of naming the app, but nevertheless it’s a solid contender as a downloading tool.

However, when it comes to doing a repost, Instagram has made it deliberately less than easy to do so. In fact, their terms of use state you must seek permission to repost videos&#x2F;photos on Instagram, either by commenting or direct messaging the content owner. If you have this consent in place, your next hurdle will be how to actually repost videos&#x2F;photos on Instagram.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Instagram Video&#x2F;Photo Downloaders – Online &amp; Add-ons &amp; App Solutions &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Repost-Photos-and-Video-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#How-to-Repost-Photos-and-Video-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Repost Photos and Video on Instagram"></a>How to Repost Photos and Video on Instagram</h2><p>There are a few different ways to repost videos and photos on Instagram, so let’s explore a couple of the most common and popular to see which is going to work for you.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Use Apps</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Screenshot</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Share to other social media platforms</a></li></ul><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Apps"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Apps"></a>Method 1: Use Apps</h3><p>The first way to repost Instagram content is via an app, and lucky for you, there are plenty of them out there.

It doesn’t require any separate log in to be done, and is free, with minimal ads to interfere with the usability. It also doesn’t watermark your repost, which is a big plus when you’re not keen to advertise someone else’s product for free.</p><p>Download for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id1120744554" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Repost-–-Photo-Video-Download-And-Save"><a href="#2-Repost-–-Photo-Video-Download-And-Save" class="headerlink" title="2.

It doesn’t have a huge amount of features, but that does make it super simple to learn to use, so is great for the first time reposter. It does watermark the photo, however, and although free to download, requires payment to unlock the advanced features.</p><p>Download for<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.repost" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Repost-and-Save-for-Instagram"><a href="#3-Repost-and-Save-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="3.

However, although it purports to be free, you’ll need to shell out a few bucks to unlock even the most basic of features. However, if you don’t mind paying, this is a solid choice that works with stories as well as video and photo content.</p><p><strong>Download for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/repost-from-save-for-instagram/id1337649070" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><h4 id="4-Repost-for-Instagram-Regrann"><a href="#4-Repost-for-Instagram-Regrann" class="headerlink" title="4.

Screenshotting can be done via a variety of methods depending on your device. Samsungs, for instance, often accept a swipe of the side of the hand across the screen, whereas iPhones prefer a simultaneous press of the power and home button. The image on your screen will be stored on your camera roll.</p><p>To use this functionality to repost Instagram shots, simply navigate to the content you want to share, tap it to make it full screen, then screenshot it. You may need to crop it in your photo editor, or with some phones you’ll be able to upload it just as it is. Now all you need to do is to upload it to your own Instagram account and you’re done.</p><p>Screenshotting is pretty low on the copyright maintenance scale, so be sure to credit the original poster in your regram, otherwise, you could land up in hot water.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-Share-to-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Method-3-Share-to-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Share to other social media platforms"></a>Method 3: Share to other social media platforms</h3><p>To repost videos&#x2F;photos on Instagram to other social networks is really easy, and is slightly more acceptable with grammers, as it can get them more traffic. To do it, click the three grey dots at the top of the post and copy the URL to your device’s clipboard. To share it on Facebook, Twitter or anywhere else, just paste the link into your post.</p><p>If someone clicks on your reposted content, they will be taken to the original posters’ Instagram account. This can drive extra followers to their feed, so most posters don’t mind this method as much as screenshotting. However, it still makes sense to obtain permission, and to credit that person when you make your regram.</p><h3 id="The-final-word"><a href="#The-final-word" class="headerlink" title="The final word"></a>The final word</h3><p>Being able to repost videos&#x2F;photos on Instagram doesn’t necessarily mean that you should. As previously mentioned, reposting without crediting the content owner is a copyright infringement and is against Instagram’s terms of use. Taking other people’s content and passing it off as your own is a big no-no, and at best will get your Instagram account suspended, at worst could result in a fine or criminal charge.</p><p>Seek permission, give credit where credit’s due, and enjoy being able to repost Instagram content without infringing anyone’s rights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhancing-viewer-attention-igtv-cover-tips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enhancing Viewer Attention IGTV Cover Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-the-influence-of-luts-on-digital-imagery-quality/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Exploring the Influence of LUTs on Digital Imagery Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-strategic-use-of-instagram-story-sections-for-brands/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Strategic Use of Instagram Story Sections for Brands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-visionary-composer-dual-elements-conjoined/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Visionary Composer Dual Elements Conjoined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-restore-order-fixing-compromised-fb-profile-for-2024/"><u>[New] Restore Order Fixing Compromised Fb Profile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-perfecting-the-art-of-borders-in-instagram-photos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Perfecting the Art of Borders in Instagram Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-online-video-editing-software-for-improved-content/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Online Video Editing Software for Improved Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-apples-silicon-spectrum-comparing-m1-pro-and-the-powerhouse-m1-max/"><u>2024 Approved Apple's Silicon Spectrum Comparing M1 Pro and the Powerhouse M1 Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagram-angles-the-complete-manual-for-effective-video-turns/"><u>2024 Approved Instagram Angles The Complete Manual for Effective Video Turns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagram-music-copyright-rules/"><u>2024 Approved Instagram Music Copyright Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-corrupt-mp4-and-mov-files-of-apple-iphone-15-plus-using-video-repair-utility-on-mac-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair corrupt MP4 and MOV files of Apple iPhone 15 Plus using Video Repair Utility on Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/transforming-mindfulness-through-technology-how-chatgpt-can-help-you-meditate-regularly/"><u>Transforming Mindfulness Through Technology: How ChatGPT Can Help You Meditate Regularly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/video-editors-alternatives-to-inshot/"><u>Video Editors Alternatives to Inshot</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You have probably heard about companies getting Instagram influencers to market their products or services. Since influencers have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers, they offer companies a wide reach in these marketing campaigns. But how can you find Instagram influencers on a tight budget?</p><p> We attempt to explain the process of finding the right Instagram influencers for your niche marketing campaign.</p><h2 id="Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free"><a href="#Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free"></a>Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria"><a href="#Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Establish Your Criteria"></a>Step 1: Establish Your Criteria</h3><p> Before you go any further in the search for influencers, it is important to understand your marketing goals. Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content. You will be offering them a product or service in exchange for the branded content they will produce. And you are relying on that content being great.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers"><a href="#Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Analyze Your Followers"></a>Step 2: Analyze Your Followers</h3><p> It is surprising how many companies are able to find influencers just by looking through their own followers. Assess your Instagram account and see if you can find users who are regularly liking posts or commenting on them.</p><p> When you find users who have a high engagement on your profile, you can assess their profiles to see if any of them have high follower counts. If one or two of them have more than 10,000 followers, they could be useful to you for influencer marketing.</p><p> Even if you do not find anything through your own followers, you can always use related keyword hashtags to find influencers who are interested in the products or services that your company offers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network"><a href="#Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Use an Influencer Network"></a>Step 3: Use an Influencer Network</h3><p> There are some very useful influencer networks that are available for free. While the free networks do not have the same analysis as paid varieties, they are still very useful in the search for Instagram influencers.</p><p> You can use an influencer network to find Instagram influencers who may have an interest in the niche that your company is targeting. All you need is a few promising leads that may be interested in talking and collaborating with your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-network.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer network"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers"><a href="#Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers"></a>Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers</h3><p> Through steps two and three, you should have been able to get at least 10 to 15 names of Instagram influencers who are interested in your niche. If you got lucky, you may have found a couple who have a serious interest in your company, making the coming talks even easier.</p><p> Most influencers will have an email address that you can use to contact them for business enquiries. Use that address to send them a formal message. If they do not have any contact method, you can always send them a direct message on Instagram to get their attention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-instagram-influencers.JPG"                      alt="contact influencer"                ></p><p> When contacting an influencer, make sure you are being very open about the invitation. Talk about your company and brand, mention the product or service you are interested in an influencer marketing, and discuss the potential budget. If you want the influencer’s help for free, make sure you are mentioning this fact in the initial message.</p><p> Do not feel disheartened if a few influencers ignore your messages. There are so many companies contacting influencers for their assistance. It is normal that some message will be ignored or lost in the shuffle.</p><p> It is why you must cast your net far and wide. Contact as many relevant influencers as you can. The more people you contact, the greater your chance of getting into a collaboration with a few influencers for free.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors"></a>Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors</h3><p> A great way to find influencers who may be interested in promoting your products or services is by looking at what your competitors are doing.</p><p> Do not focus on the most popular company in the niche, as they may be able to offer influencers better compensation.</p><p> Look at companies in the niche who have a similar size and profile to your company. You can look at all the posts where your competitors have been tagged in. These posts will show you if there are popular Instagram influencers who are advertising the products or services that your competitors are offering.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> It can be hard to find Instagram influencers for a niche marketing campaign, especially if you are working on a limited budget. But the good news is that influencers also want to raise their profile by working with brands in their niche. It can be a mutually beneficial relationship. And if your company continues to grow through the marketing you are doing with Instagram influencers, you could even establish a long term relationship with that influencer.</p><p> If you are planning to edit Instagram video, you might want to try Filmora right now.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-5-superior-videophoto-artists-that-compose-for-2024/"><u>[New] Discover the 5 Superior Video/Photo Artists That Compose for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-from-unknown-to-social-superstar-master-these-15-insta-growth-strategies-for-fast-results/"><u>[New] From Unknown to Social Superstar Master These 15 Insta Growth Strategies for Fast Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-camera-roll-to-igtv-video-upload-101/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved From Camera Roll to IGTV Video Upload 101</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-captioning-for-social-video-content-from-snapchat-to-igtv/"><u>[Updated] Captioning for Social Video Content From Snapchat to IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-from-novice-to-pro-instagram-live-walkthrough/"><u>[Updated] From Novice to Pro Instagram Live Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-photo-pinnacle-insta-coverage-excellence-on-ios-and-android/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Photo Pinnacle Insta Coverage Excellence on iOS & Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-smooth-loop-setup-tailoring-youtube-content-for-television/"><u>[Updated] Smooth Loop Setup Tailoring YouTube Content for Television</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-smooth-playback-overcoming-booty-freezes/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Smooth Playback Overcoming Booty Freezes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/1723013903951-fixing-the-infamous-crash-glitch-in-dragon-quest-xi-gamers-relief/"><u>Fixing the Infamous Crash Glitch in Dragon Quest XI: Gamer's Relief.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-vivo-y78t-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Vivo Y78t Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/top-windows-painting-and-sketchpad-programs-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>Top Windows Painting and Sketchpad Programs Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Each platform is slightly different, so you can’t use the same information when sharing a post on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV. However, the videos you share on your IGTV channel can benefit quite a bit from simple things like a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video title, a description of a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a cover photo. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of creating and changing an IGTV cover photo.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</li><li>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</li><li>Part 3: Bonus! Edit Your IGTV Video with Filmora</li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV"><a href="#Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV"></a>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</h2><p>IGTV is centered around the idea that people hold their phones vertically while watching videos, and for that reason, all videos on this platform are in the <strong>9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. Hence the cover photos you can add to your IGTV videos have to be <strong>vertically oriented</strong> as well, and if you would like to prevent IGTV from cropping your cover photo, you need to make sure that the picture matches the platform’s specifications. If you follow these specifications the cover photos for your IGTV videos are going to look equally good inside the IGTV app, the Instagram.com website, Instagram app search grid or Instagram app search feed.</p><p>YouTuber The K Guy has made a video to demonstrate the IGTV Cover Thumbnail size and dimensions and safe zone. You can check the video tutorial below.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to make thumbnails with an online thumbnail maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The images you use as cover photos for your videos will be displayed in different aspect ratios depending on the device that is used to view them. You can use a picture that has <strong>1080X1680</strong> pixels, <strong>a near 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>, as a cover photo for all IGTV videos you upload to your channel or you can choose to work with smaller images that <strong>have 420X654 pixels and a 1:1.55 aspect ratio.</strong> If you upload a cover photo that has <strong>1080X1920 pixels</strong> the platform will automatically <strong>crop approximately 120 pixels</strong> from both shorter and longer sides of the image. The size of a file you’re using for an IGTV video cover photo cannot exceed <strong>4MB,</strong> and the file must be saved as <strong>a JPEG</strong> since presently this is the only picture file format supported by IGTV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/igtv-cover-photo-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="IGTV Cover Photo Safe Zone "                ></p><p>While creating a cover photo for an IGTV video you need to keep in mind that different graphics and text overlays are going to be displayed over the picture once you upload it to your channel. During the process of uploading IGTV video’s cover photo, you will be able to add text to it, but the <strong>Title Safe Area</strong> suggests where you can place the text without the risk of it being cropped while being viewed from different devices won’t be shown. So, make sure that all text you add to your IGTV video cover photo is <strong>placed in the central area of the image</strong> in order for it to be clearly visible on all devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918661/19272" target="_top" id="1918661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918661/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</h2><p>Adding a cover photo to your IGTV video is easy since you just have <strong>to upload a photo from your camera roll or from a video.</strong> After adding a title of a video and a description you can simply tap on <strong>the Edit Cover option</strong> and select either <strong>Upload from Camera Roll or Choose Cover from Video</strong> options and proceed to pick the image you want to upload. In case you choose to add a picture from a video you will be able to navigate to the exact point in the video where the still frame you’d like to use a cover photo is located. The picture will be automatically added as your cover photo as soon as you confirm the changes.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Photo editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iPhones and Android</strong> devices can help you create captivating cover photos for your IGTV videos, but you can also edit your IGTV cover photos with the image editor that is available in Instagram Stories.

A cover photo can often be a reason why people choose to watch a video since it can spark their curiosity or attract their attention by suggesting what the video is about.

Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio. Once you made the calculations return to Filmora and click on the Manually option in the Crop and Pan screen. Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-essential-strategies-to-save-instagram-stories-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Strategies to Save Instagram Stories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-differences-between-ig-reels-vs-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling the Differences Between IG Reels Vs Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-navigating-through-instagrams-new-trends-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Through Instagram's New Trends for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-your-snap-zoom-levels-unveiled-in-insta-stories/"><u>[New] Perfecting Your Snap Zoom Levels Unveiled in Insta Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-detailed-instructions-mastering-the-art-of-uploading-vr-media-to-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Detailed Instructions Mastering the Art of Uploading VR Media to FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-covert-community-top-5-anonymous-viewers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Covert Community Top 5 Anonymous Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boosting-engagement-uploading-and-sharing-on-instagram-desktop/"><u>2024 Approved Boosting Engagement Uploading and Sharing on Instagram Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-orientation-overhaul-instagrams-video-rotation-secret/"><u>2024 Approved Orientation Overhaul Instagram's Video Rotation Secret</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/1726221140327-mkv-webm-movavi/"><u>免費線上 MKV 改成 WEBM：簡單教程運用 Movavi 轉檔器</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/holistic-evaluation-full-screenflow-for-mac-functionality-for-2024/"><u>Holistic Evaluation Full ScreenFlow for Mac Functionality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-dragon-age-origins-from-crashing-on-your-windows-10-pc/"><u>How to Stop Dragon Age: Origins From Crashing on Your Windows 10 PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/in-2024-youtubes-flawless-beauty-masterclass-skincare-hairdos-and-cosmetics/"><u>In 2024, YouTube's Flawless Beauty Masterclass Skincare, Hairdos & Cosmetics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagram-tracking-your-followers-departure/"><u>Instagram Tracking Your Followers' Departure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/learn-to-flip-film-sequences-on-iphone-for-2024/"><u>Learn to Flip Film Sequences on iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/quick-fixes-for-why-is-my-motorola-moto-g23-black-and-white-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Quick Fixes for Why Is My Motorola Moto G23 Black and White | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/top-10-roguelike-or-roguelite-games/"><u>Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/will-ispoofer-update-on-honor-v-purse-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will iSpoofer update On Honor V Purse | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100538/7443" target="_top" id="2100538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos"></a>7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts"></a>9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts</h4><p>There is something strangely satisfying about watching others open gifts or things they got in the mail. This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?

Instagram highlights provide a means for users to draw attention to and promote their brand. With these highlights, users can showcase and categorize their best content in a fancy and eye-catching way! Amazing right? Yes, it is and this is because Instagram highlights are front and center on your profile! This is a guide to Instagram highlights which explains what they are and how to use them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?</h2><p>Instagram highlights, also known as Instagram story highlights, were introduced on the 5th December of 2017. An Instagram Highlight is displayed as a neat little circle on your profile. Unlike Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Instagram highlights stay on your profile permanently, until you choose to delete them. These highlights are tools designed by Instagram to enable its users to hold on to their favorite moments from their Instagram stories and share them in any way that allows them to express themselves.</p><p>Instagram highlights were included as a new feature of Instagram profiles through which users can express more about who they are through the various stories they have shared. They are designed to appear in the section on your profile which is located below your bio.</p><p>Story Highlights allows you to display all sides of your personality, and you can create highlights from anything you’ve already posted to your Story. From moments from your birthday dinner to moments of your vacation with friends. All these cherished memories, when shared on your Stories, can be saved and featured as Highlights on your Instagram profile.</p><p>An amazing feature of Instagram highlights is that you can group your stories into sections and create them as folder sections (i.e highlights) on your profile. Once you post a story, you can save it in a Highlight (which is like a folder) and that will automatically be featured on your profile permanently until you decide to delete it or archive it. With this tool, you can design your profile in a unique way that best expresses you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Highlights are created through your Stories. You have two options for creating a Highlight. The first is that you either create a Highlight from a current Story or your Stories Archive.</p><p>Your Stories Archive is a feature that when enabled, ensures your Stories are automatically saved in your archive. Only you will be able to see them when the Stories have disappeared after 24 hours.

Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view. The number of views a video gets indicates the total number of people who interacted with it, even for a period of time that is as brief as a couple of seconds.</p><p><strong>Engagements –</strong> This metric shows you the combined number of likes and comments a video has at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention –</strong> A rather important statistic that tells you the percentage of all viewers who watched a video from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention Graph –</strong> A visual representation of the percentage of all views a video has at any moment. You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic.

We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle.
