As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.</p><p>Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!</p><p><strong>Vocalist:</strong> The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.</p><p><strong>Announcer:</strong> The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!</p><p><strong>Robot:</strong> The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?"></a>Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?</h2><p>Just like you can change your voice when filming a story, you can try the same voice-changing filter while recording a reel. Since Reels stay on your account, it makes sense to transform your usual reels into something extraordinary, and the voice changer effect helps you achieve that impeccably. Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + icon. And then click on the Reels option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-reels.jpg"                      alt="create Instagram Reels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your left, you will see the filter option; please click on that. When the filters appear, look at the top of the filters, and you will see a search bar. There, you need to type voice effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-voice-effects-instagram-reels.jpg"                      alt="add voice effect in Instagram Reels"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The voice effects filter will appear.

Mobile phones come with unique features that make life easier and more enjoyable.</p><p>Various software and applications have been developed and can be used to find solutions in many ways and in many industries.</p><p>With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, video creation has become increasingly important in many products and organizations.</p><p>Many business owners have found that there is a great deal of value in making engaging video content that can be costly and quality.</p><p>Many industries specialize in creating mind-boggling video content. But what happens when a beginner wishes to create something of the same effect, quality and attractiveness? A variety of applications can help beginners create great content without the need for office space or high-end devices. This little secret is iMovie.</p><p><strong>iMovie Square Video</strong></p><p>One software that works well within the digital space is a video editing application known as iMovie. It is a video editing software supported for macOS, iOS, and iPad OS devices.</p><p>This app was developed in the late 20th century in 1999 and features an easy-to-use interface with a timeline, a preview window, and a media browser.</p><p>Many experts consider iMovie to be a contemporary non-linear editor. With little or no technical experience, videos can be cut or edited without changing the original format of the file using its many features.</p><p>With the high cost of some editing apps, Movie seems to be a good choice for beginners. The Movie is accurate, just like any other Apple product. This software was created with the idea that not everyone is a great editor or expert.</p><p>iMovie is easy to use and with a bit of practice. A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.</p><p><strong>Why Square Videos?</strong></p><p>It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.</p><p>One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.</p><p>Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user’s screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.</p><p>There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green&#x2F;blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.</p><p>By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.</p><p>Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.</p><p>A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.</p><p>Let’s look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?</h2><p>Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you’d like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen’s corner. You’ll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method. It will just zoom in on your video and possibly crop out any unwanted things.</p><p>To use the crop&#x2F;zoom feature in iMovie on iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> On your iPhone, open the iMovie app.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Projects</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The enormous + sign should be tapped. Choose a movie.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Go to the video you want to crop and select it, then press <strong>Create Movie</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Three portions will appear on your screen. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, tap the timeline section.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, tap the small magnifying glass.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> You may now zoom in and out of your movie with your thumb and forefinger.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Press the play button to see a preview of the video.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top left corner when you’re satisfied with the results.</p><p><strong>Step #10.</strong> To save your movie to your Camera Roll, tap the square with an arrow icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>iMovie does not allow you to make square videos! You won’t be able to convert your video to square dimensions because there isn’t a way to do it. We’ll edit the video in iMovie and then modify the proportions in Keynote. Only Keynote will be used to crop the video into square dimensions. On Mac OS, Keynote is a presentation program that comes preloaded. First, use iMovie to edit your video as you typically would. Make all of the necessary modifications to the audio and video. Make use of iMovie’s special editing features. After you’ve finished editing the video, export it from iMovie.</p><p>Let’s adjust the dimensions of your video to square using Keynote now that you’ve edited and polished it in iMovie:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Select the “Basic White” theme from the Basic section of Keynote.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> To select the text boxes, click and drag (or use “cmd + A”) them, then tap “delete”.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The video should now be dragged and dropped onto the blank slide. Click the <strong>Document</strong> tab in the top right corner of the screen, then pick “Custom Slide Size…” from the <strong>Slide Size</strong> dropdown menu.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> To make a square video, make sure that both the width and height of the movie are the same. For example, if the video’s width is 500 pixels, the height should be 500 pixels as well. Once you’ve finished customizing the width and height of the slide, click “OK” to save it in these dimensions.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Drag one of your video’s corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> Click the <strong>Text</strong> button in the top center of the screen to add text to your square video. Simply drag and drop your logo or any other pictures into the video to add them.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> To change the background color, first click on the white background area, then go to the <strong>Format</strong> tab in the top right corner and select a color from the <strong>Background</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Finally, click “File” &gt; “Export To” &gt; “Movie…” to export the video. There will be a popup window. Choose a video resolution and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Select a location to save your square video and then click <strong>Export</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036496/19272" target="_top" id="2036496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036496/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?"></a>Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?</h2><p>Facebook is dominating the top ranks in video consumption platforms across the internet, thanks to its high video consumption rate.

Each platform is slightly different, so you can’t use the same information when sharing a post on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV. However, the videos you share on your IGTV channel can benefit quite a bit from simple things like a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video title, a description of a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a cover photo. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of creating and changing an IGTV cover photo.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</li><li>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</li><li>Part 3: Bonus! Edit Your IGTV Video with Filmora</li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV"><a href="#Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV"></a>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</h2><p>IGTV is centered around the idea that people hold their phones vertically while watching videos, and for that reason, all videos on this platform are in the <strong>9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. Hence the cover photos you can add to your IGTV videos have to be <strong>vertically oriented</strong> as well, and if you would like to prevent IGTV from cropping your cover photo, you need to make sure that the picture matches the platform’s specifications. If you follow these specifications the cover photos for your IGTV videos are going to look equally good inside the IGTV app, the Instagram.com website, Instagram app search grid or Instagram app search feed.</p><p>YouTuber The K Guy has made a video to demonstrate the IGTV Cover Thumbnail size and dimensions and safe zone. You can check the video tutorial below.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to make thumbnails with an online thumbnail maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The images you use as cover photos for your videos will be displayed in different aspect ratios depending on the device that is used to view them. You can use a picture that has <strong>1080X1680</strong> pixels, <strong>a near 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>, as a cover photo for all IGTV videos you upload to your channel or you can choose to work with smaller images that <strong>have 420X654 pixels and a 1:1.55 aspect ratio.</strong> If you upload a cover photo that has <strong>1080X1920 pixels</strong> the platform will automatically <strong>crop approximately 120 pixels</strong> from both shorter and longer sides of the image. The size of a file you’re using for an IGTV video cover photo cannot exceed <strong>4MB,</strong> and the file must be saved as <strong>a JPEG</strong> since presently this is the only picture file format supported by IGTV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/igtv-cover-photo-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="IGTV Cover Photo Safe Zone "                ></p><p>While creating a cover photo for an IGTV video you need to keep in mind that different graphics and text overlays are going to be displayed over the picture once you upload it to your channel. During the process of uploading IGTV video’s cover photo, you will be able to add text to it, but the <strong>Title Safe Area</strong> suggests where you can place the text without the risk of it being cropped while being viewed from different devices won’t be shown. So, make sure that all text you add to your IGTV video cover photo is <strong>placed in the central area of the image</strong> in order for it to be clearly visible on all devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</h2><p>Adding a cover photo to your IGTV video is easy since you just have <strong>to upload a photo from your camera roll or from a video.</strong> After adding a title of a video and a description you can simply tap on <strong>the Edit Cover option</strong> and select either <strong>Upload from Camera Roll or Choose Cover from Video</strong> options and proceed to pick the image you want to upload. In case you choose to add a picture from a video you will be able to navigate to the exact point in the video where the still frame you’d like to use a cover photo is located. The picture will be automatically added as your cover photo as soon as you confirm the changes.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Photo editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iPhones and Android</strong> devices can help you create captivating cover photos for your IGTV videos, but you can also edit your IGTV cover photos with the image editor that is available in Instagram Stories.

A cover photo can often be a reason why people choose to watch a video since it can spark their curiosity or attract their attention by suggesting what the video is about.

While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1.

Buffergram"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://buffergram.com/" >Buffergram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Unlike many other companies that just provide scheduling services, Buffergram actually posts your content to Instagram. This platform is aimed at high-end professionals who can’t afford a second-rate service, which is why it also tells you how well your posts are performing on Instagram. Furthermore, their Agency package allows you to handle several Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><p>People who choose to utilize Buffergram’s services can choose who many posts per day they want, so a post a day will cost you just $5 dollars a month while 5 daily posts cost $20 per month.

Onlypult"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://onlypult.com/" >Onlypult <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is an easy to use and cost-effective tool that automatically posts scheduled photos and videos to your Instagram account. What’s more Onlypult stores your hashtags, which means that you can easily add hashtags you already used to new posts. During the scheduling process, you can upload as many photos and videos as you want and you can also apply filters, select the aspect ratio or add captions.</p><p>For $55 a month you can manage 40 Instagram accounts and post an unlimited number of posts to each of these accounts, which is the reason why Onlypult is the perfect tool for your Instagram marketing campaign.</p><h4 id="5-Gramblr"><a href="#5-Gramblr" class="headerlink" title="5. Gramblr"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://gramblr.en.softonic.com/" >Gramblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This desktop app enables you to post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop. Gramblr doesn’t offer scheduling services, but it is so easy to use that most digital marketers will have to think twice before choosing to use some other option for uploading content to Instagram. Gramblr is available for both Mac and Windows OS and it offers more than 50 filters. In addition, you can add captions in any language, while you can also keep track of the basic analytics.</p><p>You can download Gramblr for free, but despite its advantages, this app lacks more advanced option that makes posting to Instagram much easier.</p><h4 id="6-Later"><a href="#6-Later" class="headerlink" title="6.

Furthermore, individuals can use Latter for free as long as they want, while agencies and large marketing teams can manage up to five accounts per platform for only $49 per month.</p><p>Latter gives you access to advanced analytics that can be essential to your online marketing strategy and it allows you to upload content from your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p><h4 id="7-Schedugr"><a href="#7-Schedugr" class="headerlink" title="7. Schedugr"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://schedugr.am/" >Schedugr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is probably one of the most convenient tools for uploading photos and videos to Instagram because all uploads are automatic. You can crop, add filters and text or rotate images, while you can also post immediately or schedule a post. ScheduGram’s users can manage several accounts at the same time and save a significant amount of time by scheduling posts months in advance.</p><p>The pricing plans are based on the number of accounts you are managing with this tool, which means that you’ll have to pay $20 per month to manage a single account with ScheduGram.

This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.</p><p> So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies.

There’s no need to worry about photo sizes or aspect ratios because Instagram is going to the all the heavy work for you.</p><p>Troubles begin when you want to upload photos and videos that weren’t captured with a Smartphone to Instagram. In most cases, the photos and videos produced by DSLR cameras and other semi-professional and professional equipment are much larger than the sizes supported by Instagram. That is the reason why we created this guide that will help you post visual content that is perfectly adjusted to Instagram in 2021.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram"><a href="#Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Types of Files Accepted by Instagram"></a>Types of Files Accepted by Instagram</h2><p>The first thing you need to pay attention to when uploading images and videos to Instagram is that the files you are uploading are in one of the photo or video formats that Instagram supports.</p><p><strong>Photo File Types</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Instagram supports only two file formats. You should make sure that your photo is either saved in <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> file format because all other file formats won’t do the trick, and you’ll be forced to go back to the photo editor you used and change the file format before you can upload a photo to Instagram. Posting GIF files is not possible without apps such as GIPHY CAM or GifLab because this type of files isn’t supported by Instagram.</p><p><strong>Video File Types</strong></p><p>Things get much easier when it comes to video since Instagram supports nearly all video file formats you can think of. However, the most commonly used types of video files uploaded to Instagram are have an  codec and a MP.4 file extension, which is the reason why we recommend converting your video files into this file format before uploading them to Instagram.</p><p>Duration of Videos on Instagram</p><p>You can either upload a video to Instagram’s main feed or you can upload it as a story. If you decide to upload a video to the main feed, the time limit is set at just 60 seconds, while the length of a video in an Instagram story cannot exceed 15 seconds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts"><a href="#Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts"></a>Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts</h2><p>A couple of years ago, Instagram has finally allowed its users to upload images that aren’t square shaped. In 2021, you can also upload horizontally and vertically oriented photos in addition to the standard square shape. However, in order to create a perfect Instagram post, and prevent the platform from cropping your photos you need to use the Instagram image sizes featured below.</p><h4 id="Instagram’s-Main-Feed"><a href="#Instagram’s-Main-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Instagram’s Main Feed"></a>Instagram’s Main Feed</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-sizes-infographic-1.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The main feed on Instagram is the place where all the posts from people you are following on this platform are displayed. So let’s take a look at the perfect Instagram photo sizes for the main feed.</p><ul><li><strong>Square</strong></li></ul><p>Most digital cameras don’t produce this shape of a photo, which means that you’ll have to change width and height values before you upload a photo to Instagram. The best Instagram photo size for square-shaped images is 1080 px X 1080 px in 1:1 aspect ratio because if you use a picture that has fewer or more pixels than that, the platform may resize your photo automatically.</p><ul><li><strong>Landscape</strong></li></ul><p>This type of picture orientation is frequently used for both videos and photos, however, if you want to upload a horizontally oriented photo to Instagram, we recommend that you use 1,91:1 aspect ratio and 1080 px X 566 px values for the size of a photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Portrait</strong></li></ul><p>Portrait or vertically oriented photos on Instagram should have 8:10 aspect ratio and a 1080 px size value for the shorter side of a photo, and 1350 px value for the longer side of a photo you’d like to post to Instagram.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Stories"><a href="#Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Stories"></a>Instagram Stories</h4><p>The photos you post as stories on Instagram are always vertically oriented and for that reason, you should change their aspect ratio to 9:16 and set their size to 1080X1920px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Profile-Pictures"><a href="#Instagram-Profile-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Profile Pictures"></a>Instagram Profile Pictures</h4><p>The profile pictures on Instagram are tiny, and the optimum size for them is 160X160 px, while their shape is always a square which means that you’ll have to set their aspect ratio to 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You have probably heard about companies getting Instagram influencers to market their products or services. Since influencers have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers, they offer companies a wide reach in these marketing campaigns. But how can you find Instagram influencers on a tight budget?</p><p> We attempt to explain the process of finding the right Instagram influencers for your niche marketing campaign.</p><h2 id="Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free"><a href="#Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free"></a>Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria"><a href="#Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Establish Your Criteria"></a>Step 1: Establish Your Criteria</h3><p> Before you go any further in the search for influencers, it is important to understand your marketing goals. Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content. You will be offering them a product or service in exchange for the branded content they will produce. And you are relying on that content being great.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers"><a href="#Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Analyze Your Followers"></a>Step 2: Analyze Your Followers</h3><p> It is surprising how many companies are able to find influencers just by looking through their own followers. Assess your Instagram account and see if you can find users who are regularly liking posts or commenting on them.</p><p> When you find users who have a high engagement on your profile, you can assess their profiles to see if any of them have high follower counts. If one or two of them have more than 10,000 followers, they could be useful to you for influencer marketing.</p><p> Even if you do not find anything through your own followers, you can always use related keyword hashtags to find influencers who are interested in the products or services that your company offers.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network"><a href="#Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Use an Influencer Network"></a>Step 3: Use an Influencer Network</h3><p> There are some very useful influencer networks that are available for free. While the free networks do not have the same analysis as paid varieties, they are still very useful in the search for Instagram influencers.</p><p> You can use an influencer network to find Instagram influencers who may have an interest in the niche that your company is targeting. All you need is a few promising leads that may be interested in talking and collaborating with your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-network.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer network"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers"><a href="#Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers"></a>Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers</h3><p> Through steps two and three, you should have been able to get at least 10 to 15 names of Instagram influencers who are interested in your niche. If you got lucky, you may have found a couple who have a serious interest in your company, making the coming talks even easier.</p><p> Most influencers will have an email address that you can use to contact them for business enquiries. Use that address to send them a formal message. If they do not have any contact method, you can always send them a direct message on Instagram to get their attention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-instagram-influencers.JPG"                      alt="contact influencer"                ></p><p> When contacting an influencer, make sure you are being very open about the invitation. Talk about your company and brand, mention the product or service you are interested in an influencer marketing, and discuss the potential budget. If you want the influencer’s help for free, make sure you are mentioning this fact in the initial message.</p><p> Do not feel disheartened if a few influencers ignore your messages. There are so many companies contacting influencers for their assistance. It is normal that some message will be ignored or lost in the shuffle.</p><p> It is why you must cast your net far and wide. Contact as many relevant influencers as you can. The more people you contact, the greater your chance of getting into a collaboration with a few influencers for free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors"></a>Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors</h3><p> A great way to find influencers who may be interested in promoting your products or services is by looking at what your competitors are doing.</p><p> Do not focus on the most popular company in the niche, as they may be able to offer influencers better compensation.</p><p> Look at companies in the niche who have a similar size and profile to your company. You can look at all the posts where your competitors have been tagged in.

How should we organise our Instagram business profile, and how can we keep it separate from our personal accounts? Here, we’ll investigate how to create an Instagram business account so that your business can benefit from this massively popular social network too.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to set up Instagram Business Account</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Should you switch to business account?</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account"><a href="#How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to set up Instagram Business Account"></a>How to set up Instagram Business Account</h2><p> Making the move to an Instagram business account is straightforward, so here’s a step by step introduction to setting up your Instagram business profile in moments.</p><h4 id="1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="1.  Switch to Instagram business profile"></a>1.  Switch to Instagram business profile</h4><p> Log into your personal Instagram account to start this process. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create an Instagram account to get started.</p><p> Once into your Instagram account, simply open your account settings which you’ll find in the cog at the top right of your screen when looking at your profile. Near the bottom of the menu you’ll find the option to ‘Switch to Business Profile’. Choose this to find out how to create Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="2-Set-up-your-profile"><a href="#2-Set-up-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2.  Set up your profile"></a>2.  Set up your profile</h4><p> Once you’ve pressed the option to switch to a business profile, you’ll see a request to connect your Instagram account to your Facebook page, with a blue link to ‘view features’. This is how to create Instagram account for your business.</p><p> In this menu you’ll be able to connect to your Facebook page, which is the best place to start. You’ll be asked which Facebook page you want to connect to; note that you can only set up an Instagram business account for pages which you administer yourself. You may only connect one Instagram business profile with each Facebook page.</p><p> From here, you can pull down contact information such as your customer service telephone number, your street address and your email contacts. You need to add at least one contact feature in order to create your Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="3.  Check your new Instagram business profile"></a>3.  Check your new Instagram business profile</h4><p> Once you’ve finished setting up your account, you can switch back to your personal account and navigate to your new Instagram business account to see how it looks from an outsider’s point of view. Try tapping the ‘contact’ button to see what sort of interaction options are available to your visitors.</p><p> Make sure you are only providing the relevant information at this stage. For example, if you are a fully online business, your customers won’t need to get directions to your address, so you can go ahead and remove your location from the contact options. If you don’t really use the phone number for business, you can choose to switch it to text message only within your Instagram business profile settings.</p><h4 id="4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features"><a href="#4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features" class="headerlink" title="4.  Check out Instagram for business features"></a>4.  Check out Instagram for business features</h4><p> Now you know how to create Instagram business account, you also need to manage it well too. There are a few features which set business accounts apart from standard user accounts, and some of these can be very useful to you in getting the most from your new Instagram business profile.</p><ul><li><strong>Insights:</strong> You’ll find the insights button at the top of your business profile next to the settings icon. Here you can see impressions, reach and clicks to your website, which are updated on a weekly basis. This feature also tracks your engagement metrics on a post by post basis, so that you can tailor what you’re posting to get more from your channel.</li><li><strong>Promote:</strong> Posts in Instagram can be boosted in a similar way to those on Facebook. This is not the same as running an ad, which you could also consider doing, but is a way to ensure more people see the content that you’ve posted.</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> Your Instagram business profile looks and feels different to the generic user account, which is a good thing. It allows users to find out about your business, to get directions or contact information for you and to click shoppable links directly.</li></ul><p> Take some time to get to know your new Instagram business account, so that you can set in place a powerful strategy to maximize your impact on this busy social channel.</p><p> So, now you know how to create Instagram business account and how to manage it too, but one question remains; should you?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947750/11832" target="_top" id="947750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947750/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-you-switch-to-business-account"><a href="#Should-you-switch-to-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Should you switch to business account?"></a>Should you switch to business account?</h2><p> With more than 800 million users and 500 million active each day, Instagram is by far the biggest and busiest social sharing network on the planet. But are there real advantages to switching to an Instagram business profile, or could you just promote your business through a standard account instead? Let’s find out:</p><h4 id="Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account"><a href="#Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Pros of switching to an Instagram business account"></a>Pros of switching to an Instagram business account</h4><p> Some of the real advantages of working with a business account include:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting found more easily:</strong> Prior to Instagram business profiles being included in the platform, the only way your customers could find or contact you was by visiting your page and clicking the link to your website. The new profiles make it much easier for people to find you, contact you and, of course, buy your products. Useful analytics: In the past, the only way to draw down analytics from Instagram was through third party apps. With the new Instagram business profile, you can monitor your posts, clicks, engagement and reach all in one simple place. This will help inform your activity on Instagram and allow you to spend your time on the most productive activities.</li><li><strong>Paid ad options:</strong> Alongside the roll out of business profiles, Instagram have beefed up their ad options too. When you hit a post on your business account, there is an option at the bottom to ‘promote’ that post. From here, you can add a call to action button, target specific audiences and choose when the ad should be run. Both boost posts and paid ads are possible with the powerful tools built into Instagram.</li><li><strong>Links on Stories:</strong> Now business Instagram accounts who have at least 10,000 followers can add links into their Stories. Stories act like promoted posts, appearing at the top of your user’s news feed and encouraging engagement, so having active links to products or your website here is gold dust.</li></ul><p> You must admit, there are some pretty powerful reasons for knowing how to create Instagram account for your business, many of which could see your enterprise drawing in new customers and new opportunities. But is that the whole story?</p><h4 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile"></a>Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile</h4><p> As with any new features, there are also some drawbacks to owning an Instagram business account. Here’s what you need to be aware of when thinking about how to create Instagram account for your company:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook requirement:</strong> In order to set up a business account on Instagram you also need to have an existing Facebook page for your business. However, the majority of businesses already make use of Facebook, and if you don’t, then you probably should.</li><li><strong>Engagement problems:</strong> Instagram is owned by Facebook, and just like Facebook, they want you to pay for ads. While they are fairly tight lipped about how their post visibility algorithm works, some users have reported a negative impact on their engagement as a result of switching. The data on this is limited at this stage, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re not a business willing to pay for your exposure.</li></ul><p> So now you know how to create Instagram business account functionality, and how to use it, as well as whether it’s a good idea for you. Will you make the switch?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="And-the-winner-is"><a href="#And-the-winner-is" class="headerlink" title="And the winner is?"></a>And the winner is?</h2><p> Right now, more than 15 million businesses are already using an Instagram business account, so in order to keep up with the competition, it makes sense to make the switch. It seems there will be no going back to the chronologically organized platform it used to be, and with all the massive benefits to switching, it makes absolute sense to adapt to the changing landscape.</p><p> Social marketing has the real potential to have a positive effect on your bottom line, with <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/695183/social-media-marketing-profitability/" >75 per cent of businesses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>stating a significant or some positive return on investment, and thanks to these new business profiles, Instagram is set to be a real contributor to your profits. Our clear winner is the Instagram business profile, so make the switch today and let us know how it works for you!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dreaming-through-the-viewfinder-inspiring-photo-ideas/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Dreaming Through the Viewfinder Inspiring Photo Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-increase-engagement-on-igtv-with-top-notch-titles-and-summaries/"><u>[New] In 2024, Increase Engagement on IGTV with Top-Notch Titles and Summaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-understanding-the-shift-navigating-posting-in-an-algorithm-world-for-2024/"><u>[New] Understanding the Shift Navigating Posting in an Algorithm World for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-glow-up-guide-for-the-social-savvy-top-three-highlighters-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Glow-Up Guide for the Social Savvy Top Three Highlighters on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transform-your-archive-with-instagrams-filters-an-easy-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transform Your Archive with Instagram’s Filters – An Easy Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-the-entrepreneurial-roadmap-for-starting-an-online-product-critique-site-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Entrepreneurial Roadmap for Starting an Online Product Critique Site for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-game-plan-for-getting-your-product-in-front-of-a-youtubers-audience/"><u>[Updated] The Game Plan for Getting Your Product in Front of a Youtuber's Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-visual-storytelling-for-social-media-editing-vt-videos-in-fcpx-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visual Storytelling for Social Media Editing VT Videos in FCPX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/1723862728742-get-the-best-bargain-asus-tuf-gaming-laptop-with-amd-ryzen-for-a-shocking-memorial-day-sale-only-658/"><u>Get the Best Bargain -

You will now see your video with the <strong>Border</strong> effect applied to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-border-to-instagram-video.jpg"                      alt="add borders to instagram video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> If you’re not fond of the <em>white borders</em> applied by default on your video, double-click on the video timeline and head over to the <strong>Video</strong> tab present on the top left corner of the interface, and tap on the <strong>Video Effects</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-adjust-border-effects.jpg"                      alt="adjust borders effects"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> The <strong>Video Effect</strong> option opens various options for further customizing your video with the Border effect. You now have the <strong>Color</strong> option to choose the one of your liking (the <em>red color</em> is applied in this picture below).</p><p>(Note: Customize the border size, blur, etc., using the options such as the <strong>Size, Blur</strong>, and <strong>Opacity</strong>).</p><p>Besides the white borders for Instgram video, you can find out more by searching border in the search bar, and you will find human border, Tarot pack overlay and much more frames for video, you can drag and drop them to the video to try free.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-border-frame-overlay-filmora.jpg" alt="add borders/frame/overlay filmora"></p><p>You can watch the video tutorial about adding borders to video in Filmora, most of the steps are the similar when adding borders to Instagram video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><em>Learn more about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to edit Instagram videos with Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em>.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Add-Border-to-Video-for-Instagram-Online-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Add-Border-to-Video-for-Instagram-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Add Border to Video for Instagram Online?"></a>Part 3: How to Add Border to Video for Instagram Online?</h2><p>In this part of the guide, we will look at three methods and guide you on how to add border to video for Instagram online using Kapwing, Canva</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068432/7443" target="_top" id="2068432">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068432" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068432/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Kapwing-3"><a href="#1-Kapwing-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Research has shown that users want to engage with you in meaningful ways, such as calling you, visiting your website, or seeking directions to your premises. In fact, <a class="link"   href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/welcoming-1-million-advertisers" >more than 120 million Instagrammers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do this every month.

Here, you can find insightful top tips on how to get more followers on IG so that your business can start to make ripples in your industry.</p><h2 id="Top-tips-on-how-to-gain-more-followers-on-Instagram"><a href="#Top-tips-on-how-to-gain-more-followers-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Top tips on how to gain more followers on Instagram"></a>Top tips on how to gain more followers on Instagram</h2><p>Here we’ll bring you our very best top tips on how to get more IG followers so that you can leverage the full power of the world’s biggest photo-sharing platform.</p><h3 id="1-Make-it-easy-for-users-to-find-you"><a href="#1-Make-it-easy-for-users-to-find-you" class="headerlink" title="1. Make it easy for users to find you"></a>1. Make it easy for users to find you</h3><p>You could have the best images, the most insightful content, and work as hard as you like on your account, but if users can’t find you, it will all be for nothing. If your fans don’t know you’re there, they are never going to follow you.</p><p>To increase your visibility, use the tools you already have in place. If you have a fan base on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network, cross-promote your Instagram page with those people, encouraging them to follow you. Consider paying to boost these posts to ensure even more of your existing fans are driven towards your Instagram account.</p><p>You can also place a link on your website to help visitors find you on Instagram and could consider including a link in your email signatures and other public-facing profiles. When you’re keen to discover how to increase followers on Instagram, maximizing the use of existing resources is a no-brainer.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-your-profile"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your profile"></a>2. Optimize your profile</h3><p>You want your profile to be a powerful piece of marketing, so don’t scrimp on your time investment here either. Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date. Take a look at the profiles of some of your competition to see what’s working for them, then you can make improvements to your own.</p><h3 id="3-Tell-a-consistent-story"><a href="#3-Tell-a-consistent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. Tell a consistent story"></a>3. Tell a consistent story</h3><p>Consistency and regularity are the keys to how to get more followers on IG. Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas. Your visuals should be instantly recognizable at a glance and should present a cohesive narrative across this social channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Use-hashtags"><a href="#4-Use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="4. Use hashtags"></a>4. Use hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags are one of the best ways of how to increase followers on IG. Good use of powerful, relevant hashtags will expose your posts to people who are not followers of your page, but who are interested in the kind of content you are producing. When you start using hashtags, achieve success quickly by:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking out the most popular:</strong> Have a look at popular hashtags for your industry. What are your competitors using? What about influencers in your niche?</li><li><strong>Using niche tags:</strong> Getting niche with your tags will grab the attention of a narrower audience, but one which is much more engaged with your business.</li><li><strong>Create your own tag:</strong> Use your own branded hashtag with your posts and promote it with contests and on other channels to get people starting to use it.</li><li><strong>Use enough hashtags:</strong> You can place up to 30 hashtags on any one post but using all 30 every time is probably a little too much. Research shows that between 9 – 11 hashtags tend to be the optimal number, but this will vary by industry.</li><li><strong>Avoid spammy hashtags:</strong> Don’t be tempted into using #like4like or #followback type tags, as although you may find you get more followers, they will be low quality and not really interested in your content.</li></ul><p>Find out more about using hashtags in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use hashtags on Instagram. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post"><a href="#5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post" class="headerlink" title="5. Pick the right time to post"></a>5. Pick the right time to post</h3><p>Posting consistently is one hurdle to overcome; refining the times at which you post is another. An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day. Use a scheduling tool to plan and organize your posts, but also make sure someone is available to respond to comments when the post goes live.</p><p>Check our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >When is The Best Time to Post on Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Guide to know more.</p><h3 id="6-Tag-other-users"><a href="#6-Tag-other-users" class="headerlink" title="6. Tag other users"></a>6. Tag other users</h3><p>Adding a specific user’s tag to your posts will encourage them to share it too, helping to expose your business to more new people. When working on how to get more IG followers, engaging with specific influencers is crucial. However, don’t just go randomly tagging them, as this is unlikely to get the desired response. Engage with them through their own posts, and then use this relationship to help grow your own following.</p><p>You can also get users to tag other users in your posts. Captions such as ‘tag someone who feels like this on a Monday’ or ‘tag the person you’d love to be on this beach with’ will get people tagging their friends like mad. Suddenly you’re exposed to many other Instagram users and have started to build your following even more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Run-a-competition"><a href="#7-Run-a-competition" class="headerlink" title="7. Run a competition"></a>7. Run a competition</h3><p>Contests and competitions are one of the best ways to find out how to get IG followers. There are many ways you can run your contest, from getting people to use a specific hashtag to asking them to comment, like, or follow your account. You don’t need to be a multibillion-dollar business to run a competition successfully, but it does need to be of high enough value to encourage interaction.</p><p>Some ideas for a competition could be:</p><ul><li>Win a fashion voucher by sharing images of the perfect work outfit</li><li>Win a camera for sharing pictures of inspirational locations</li><li>A draw to win an iPad which is entered by liking &#x2F; following your account</li><li>A merchandise goody bag for tagging a friend you’d bring to your restaurant</li></ul><p>Competitions can be great fun, so get creative and think of some exciting offers and engagement opportunities for your specific brand.</p><h3 id="8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video"><a href="#8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video" class="headerlink" title="8. Get to grips with live video"></a>8. Get to grips with live video</h3><p>Livestreaming is huge right now, on all social platforms, and Instagram is no different. It’s the ideal way to share coverage of a conference, a trade show, a training opportunity or to run a Q&amp;A session. You could showcase your factory, do a tour of your offices, cover the opening of your new store… anything really.</p><p>Live streams on Instagram appear at the top of your follower’s feeds, making it an ideal way to engage deeply with those who already follow you. Encourage viewers to tag their friends, perhaps by running a giveaway as part of the video. Users who are online when you start broadcasting will be instantly notified of your live stream, making it a great way to really grab people’s attention.</p><p>You can choose to have your stream disappear as soon as it’s been completed or to have it available in your brand’s story area for 24 hours. Your story also appears at the top of your follower’s feeds, offering you a great opportunity to engage with those who missed the live stream itself.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Go Live On Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Use-Instagram-ads"><a href="#9-Use-Instagram-ads" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Instagram ads"></a>9. Use Instagram ads</h3><p>If you’re serious about how to get more followers on IG, making use of Instagram ads is going to be important for you. These allow you to reach out to new followers rapidly, presenting your carefully crafted content to people who may never have heard of you before.</p><p>Using the advertising tools built into Instagram, you can make your ads highly targeted too. Pick who you want to see your ads based on interests and behaviors, demographics, geographic locations, and a swathe of other parameters to help you reach the right people. You are able to advertise in both Instagram feeds and in stories, so explore all your options and test different strategies to see what works best for your business.</p><h3 id="10-Use-Instagram-insights"><a href="#10-Use-Instagram-insights" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Instagram insights"></a>10. Use Instagram insights</h3><p>Instagram was the last social network to really get on board with providing data, but thank goodness they do now, and we should all be using it to discover how to gain followers on Instagram. The analytics and insights provided by Instagram are absolute marketing gold dust, so take the time to get to grips with what you can discover to continue to grow your following.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Analytics Tools for Better Tracking Your Metrics &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can view insights for your whole account using the chart button on the top right of your profile page, or for an individual post by navigating to that post and clicking ‘view insights’ in the bottom left. When you visit Insights for your account, you’ll see:</p><ul><li><strong>Impressions:</strong> How many times your ad or content appeared on feeds</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many unique users have seen your posts</li><li><strong>Clicks:</strong> A count of the times people have clicked any link you’ve added to your business profile</li><li><strong>Visits:</strong> How many times your profile page has been looked at</li><li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many followers you’ve acquired or lost in the last week</li></ul><p>The ‘followers’ section will also tell you what times of day your followers are most active, which is highly informative when it comes to planning your posting times. If you choose to view insights for a particular post, you’ll be able to see:</p><ul><li><strong>Likes:</strong> How many like your post generated</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> How many comments were left</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> How many users saved or bookmarked your post</li><li><strong>Actions:</strong> How many actions were taken, such as visiting your profile, following you or clicking a link to your website</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> This metric shows where your post was seen the most, including how many accounts were not following you when they first saw you post</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, when you start drilling down into these metrics and keeping a record of data over a period of time, it’s easy to see patterns beginning to emerge. These patterns will be crucial to tailoring your strategy as you move forward, and to ensure you know how to gain followers on Instagram ongoing.</p><p>So now you know some of the right ways of how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get more followers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on IG. However, there is one way of how to get IG followers which we have not mentioned, and that’s by buying them. We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do. Knuckle down, do things right and you’ll be growing your Instagram fanbase in no time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-negative-space-how-to-flip-vids-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Navigating Negative Space How to Flip Vids on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-selection-of-frames-for-professional-ig-artistry/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Selection of Frames for Professional IG Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlock-slow-momentum-a-filmmakers-tale-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlock Slow Momentum A Filmmaker’s Tale on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-detailed-walkthrough-embedding-online-video-into-ms-presentations/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Detailed Walkthrough Embedding Online Video Into MS Presentations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-streaming-to-facebook-audiences-using-zoom/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Streaming to Facebook Audiences Using Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-followers-with-effective-igtv-hashtag-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate Followers with Effective IGTV Hashtag Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-liberating-laughter-through-limitations-funniest-facebook-detainment-tales/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Liberating Laughter Through Limitations Funniest Facebook Detainment Tales</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-instagram-stories-download-crafting-strategies/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Instagram Stories Download, Crafting Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-converting-instagram-media-to-mp3-format/"><u>2024 Approved Converting Instagram Media To MP3 Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-audio-prime-websites-for-turning-video-melodies-into-sound-effects/"><u>2024 Approved Seamless Audio Prime Websites for Turning Video Melodies Into Sound Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-quick-fixes-unfortunately-snapchat-has-stopped-on-realme-10t-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Quick Fixes Unfortunately, Snapchat has Stopped on Realme 10T 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/boost-your-visibility-fast-instagram-likes-and-vids/"><u>Boost Your Visibility Fast Instagram Likes & Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-android-app-not-installed-error-on-nokia-c300-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Android App Not Installed Error on Nokia C300 Quickly? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/save-instastories-infinite-the-liberation-app/"><u>Save InstaStories Infinite The Liberation App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/top-4-free-software-solutions-for-monitoring-windows-pc-storage-capacity/"><u>Top 4 Free Software Solutions for Monitoring Windows PC Storage Capacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/unlock-youtubes-potential-key-strategies-from-creator-studio-manual-for-2024/"><u>Unlock YouTube's Potential Key Strategies From Creator Studio Manual for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
