Such profiles instantly get a red flag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-profile-sections.JPG"                      alt="check profile sections"                ></p><h3 id="3-Check-Engagement"><a href="#3-Check-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="3.

Check Engagement</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/" >engagement rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account. The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.</p><p> The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4.

While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1. Grum"></a>1. Grum</h4><p>Planning and scheduling your posts in advance is a great way to carry out your social media advertising campaign. Grum is the perfect tool that will enable social media managers to save time on posting content to Instagram accounts they are managing because they can schedule weekly posts.</p><p>The platform lets you upload videos and photos to your Grum account, and you can easily schedule your next post by clicking on the Schedule icon. A three-day trial is available if you want to test Grum before deciding which pricing plan best fits your needs.</p><h4 id="2-Planoly"><a href="#2-Planoly" class="headerlink" title="2. Planoly"></a>2. Planoly</h4><p>If you take your social media posts seriously, then a tool as powerful as Planoly will certainly help you with developing your Instagram accounts. The platform offers several different pricing options that start from $7 a month for a single account, while teams that need to manage as many as ten accounts can easily do so for $199 per month.</p><p>Uploading and scheduling content is fast and easy, which means that you can schedule posts months in advance. Planoly’s ‘Analyze’ option will also help you to get a better picture of your audience since it can help you increase user engagement and sales of your products.</p><h4 id="3-Buffergram"><a href="#3-Buffergram" class="headerlink" title="3. Buffergram"></a>3. Buffergram</h4><p>Unlike many other companies that just provide scheduling services, Buffergram actually posts your content to Instagram. This platform is aimed at high-end professionals who can’t afford a second-rate service, which is why it also tells you how well your posts are performing on Instagram. Furthermore, their Agency package allows you to handle several Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><p>People who choose to utilize Buffergram’s services can choose who many posts per day they want, so a post a day will cost you just $5 dollars a month while 5 daily posts cost $20 per month. Packages that include tracking services are also available.</p><h4 id="4-Onlypult"><a href="#4-Onlypult" class="headerlink" title="4. Onlypult"></a>4. Onlypult</h4><p>This is an easy to use and cost-effective tool that automatically posts scheduled photos and videos to your Instagram account. What’s more Onlypult stores your hashtags, which means that you can easily add hashtags you already used to new posts. During the scheduling process, you can upload as many photos and videos as you want and you can also apply filters, select the aspect ratio or add captions.</p><p>For $55 a month you can manage 40 Instagram accounts and post an unlimited number of posts to each of these accounts, which is the reason why Onlypult is the perfect tool for your Instagram marketing campaign.</p><h4 id="5-Gramblr"><a href="#5-Gramblr" class="headerlink" title="5. Gramblr"></a>5. Gramblr</h4><p>This desktop app enables you to post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop. Gramblr doesn’t offer scheduling services, but it is so easy to use that most digital marketers will have to think twice before choosing to use some other option for uploading content to Instagram. Gramblr is available for both Mac and Windows OS and it offers more than 50 filters. In addition, you can add captions in any language, while you can also keep track of the basic analytics.</p><p>You can download Gramblr for free, but despite its advantages, this app lacks more advanced option that makes posting to Instagram much easier.</p><h4 id="6-Later"><a href="#6-Later" class="headerlink" title="6. Later"></a>6. Later</h4><p>The fact that some of the most famous brands in the world use the services Latter provides shows that this one of the best platforms for scheduling and posting videos on Instagram.

Schedugr"></a>7. Schedugr</h4><p>This is probably one of the most convenient tools for uploading photos and videos to Instagram because all uploads are automatic. You can crop, add filters and text or rotate images, while you can also post immediately or schedule a post. ScheduGram’s users can manage several accounts at the same time and save a significant amount of time by scheduling posts months in advance.</p><p>The pricing plans are based on the number of accounts you are managing with this tool, which means that you’ll have to pay $20 per month to manage a single account with ScheduGram.

Dropbox</h4><p>Dropbox isn’t a tool that will enable you to upload photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop, but if you have Dropbox installed on your computer and Smartphone you can use it to easily post content on Instagram. After you downloaded and installed Dropbox on your computer and your Smartphone, upload the video you want to share to the desktop version of Dropbox and then find the video you uploaded from the app installed on your Smartphone.</p><p>Click on the Export option and Instagram will appear as one of the provided options, then just take the steps you would normally take if you were posting a video on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-from-unknown-to-iconic-the-journey-of-viral-instagram-films-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Unknown to Iconic  The Journey of Viral Instagram Films for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-initiating-engagement-start-your-live-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Initiating Engagement  Start Your Live on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instagrams-video-response-rate-how-to-increase-it/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Instagram's Video Response Rate  How to Increase It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/stay-ahead-adapting-your-approach-for-instagrams-evolved-feed/"><u>Stay Ahead  Adapting Your Approach for Instagram’s Evolved Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-in-a-sea-of-silence-the-perils-of-pretense-in-profiles/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, In a Sea of Silence  The Perils of Pretense in Profiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-your-reel-game-on-insta-with-tiktoks-best-practices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Reel Game on Insta with TikTok's Best Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instagram-filming-perfecting-the-chroma-key-effect/"><u>Instagram Filming  Perfecting the Chroma Key Effect</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-rise-to-the-top-the-essentials-of-starting-a-youtube-gaming-sensation/"><u>[New] Rise to the Top  The Essentials of Starting a YouTube Gaming Sensation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-tier-eyeball-enticer-author/"><u>In 2024, Top-Tier Eyeball Enticer Author</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/elevate-your-content-game-on-youtube-top-11-video-seo-insights/"><u>Elevate Your Content Game on YouTube  Top 11 Video SEO Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-stolen-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-in-different-conditionsin-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock Stolen Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max In Different Conditionsin | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-camera-roll-to-youtube-the-ultimate-uploading-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  From Camera Roll to YouTube  The Ultimate Uploading Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-infinix-smart-8-hd-have-find-my-friends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Infinix Smart 8 HD Have Find My Friends? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-sewn-sequences-learning-loom-screen-casting/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Sewn Sequences  Learning Loom Screen Casting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-expanding-youtube-audience-through-perpetual-creative-commons-for-2024/"><u>[New] Expanding YouTube Audience Through Perpetual Creative Commons for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/how-to-export-iphone-images-as-pdf-from-jpeg-and-png-files-for-2024/"><u>How to Export iPhone Images as PDF From JPEG & PNG Files for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Well, your visitors first notice your bio information and obviously one of the most useful Instagram features, the <strong>Insta highlight cover photo</strong>!</p><p>Instagram Highlights are a convenient way to direct your new followers to the content you want them to check first and the ideal way to do that is by adding Covers to your IG Highlights. Your cover pic for Highlights tends to be the first video or image from the collection of Stories that you highlighted. However, this can be changed easily. Since Highlights are positioned right below your bio, it is recommended to make your Instagram highlights cover pics as eye-catching, professional, or fun as possible.</p><p>Instagram Highlights is a great feature for business owners. This is because it gives them the chance to build trust, share vital information, promote their products or services, and highlight positive reviews from happy consumers. Insta stories have now become more like mini-blog posts that can be saved and shared directly in the app via Instagram highlights.</p><p>Confused about what is an Insta Highlight cover and how do you make one for your brand?

Located just below the bio section of your IG profile, they are used to showcase the best of your Instagram stories.</p><p>Insta highlight covers are an excellent way to save and categorize your stories. And unlike the ordinary IG stories that disappear after 24 hours, saving a story to your Highlights means it will stay there permanently. An Insta highlight cover photo is an incredible way to connect with your audience as well as promote your brand or products&#x2F;services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-photo.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover photo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Eye-Catching-Cover-Photos-For-IG-Highlights"><a href="#Part-2-10-Eye-Catching-Cover-Photos-For-IG-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Eye-Catching Cover Photos For IG Highlights"></a>Part 2: 10 Eye-Catching Cover Photos For IG Highlights</h2><p>Looking for some inspiration to create an attractive cover photo for Instagram highlights? Listed below are some great examples for businesses.</p><h4 id="1-The-New-York-Times"><a href="#1-The-New-York-Times" class="headerlink" title="1.The New York Times"></a>1.The New York Times</h4><p>The New York Times takes Instagram Stories literally. They populate their highlights with comprehensive yet readable primers on complicated political topics. Also, they create interesting, fun, and snackable Stories about the subjects that appeal most to the audience. Either way, the style of their cover image is very consistent, helping them to make the vast reach of their subjects more manageable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ig-highlight-cover-photo-nytimes.jpg"                      alt="ig highlight cover photo nytimes"                ></p><h4 id="2-Toyota"><a href="#2-Toyota" class="headerlink" title="2.Toyota"></a>2.Toyota</h4><p>The Instagram Highlights of Toyota collate information about their cars as well as the primary in-car features. They have a simple and clean design for their Highlight icons. This way, Toyota has ensured that they can grab the attention of people who missed their IG story the first time it was posted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ig-highlight-cover-photo-toyota.png"                      alt="ig highlight cover photo toyota"                ></p><h4 id="3-Starbucks"><a href="#3-Starbucks" class="headerlink" title="3.Starbucks"></a>3.Starbucks</h4><p>Starbucks Coffee uses photos of real people as the cover icons for the Highlights. It is this appeal that brings the design of their profile to life. Also, it makes the visitors feel the user-friendliness of the profile. There’s a reason why Starbucks is loved by everyone, isn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ig-highlight-cover-photo-starbucks.jpg"                      alt="ig highlight cover photo starbucks"                ></p><h4 id="4-The-Kitchn"><a href="#4-The-Kitchn" class="headerlink" title="4.The Kitchn"></a>4.The Kitchn</h4><p>The Kitchn’s all-things-food account has cooking how-tos and recipes, along with tips for organizing and cleaning the kitchen. Their IG highlights add to their regular posts and even showcase some of their behind-the-scenes action. Also, they have a Story Highlight termed Kitchn Pets where they post the images of adorable furry friends in the kitchen, from both their audience as well as staff members.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-kitchn.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover kitchn"                ></p><h4 id="5-Glossier-Inc"><a href="#5-Glossier-Inc" class="headerlink" title="5.Glossier Inc"></a>5.Glossier Inc</h4><p>Glossier Inc. is a people-powered beauty ecosystem. The brand uses pink color only for their profile image (not a logo). For the Highlights Covers, they use only white images. This makes their Highlights very minimalistic and very different than other accounts where product images or icons are generally used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-glossier.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover glossier"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fashion-Nova"><a href="#6-Fashion-Nova" class="headerlink" title="6.Fashion Nova"></a>6.Fashion Nova</h4><p>Fashion Nova, an international fashion brand, relies heavily on its ability to ship worldwide quickly. So, it’s not surprising that one of their Highlights is dedicated just to shipping. It seems as if some of their customers had certain shipping issues in the past. So, their Highlight uses rave reviews for showing that the issues have been solved, while simultaneously communicating to the new customers that they have lightning-fast shipping.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-fashion.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover fashion"                ></p><h4 id="7-Red-Bull"><a href="#7-Red-Bull" class="headerlink" title="7.Red Bull"></a>7.Red Bull</h4><p>Earlier, Red Bull’s IG Highlights used to be fairly conservative like projects, videos, events, etc. But, this has changed. Now their athletes have their own dedicated highlight. All one gets is a name, face, and emoji. Very intriguing, isn’t it? This is a great inspiration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-redbull.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover redbull"                ></p><h4 id="8-Tide"><a href="#8-Tide" class="headerlink" title="8.Tide"></a>8.Tide</h4><p>In their Instagram Highlights, Tide Bank uses colors that are consistent with their brand. This makes for the spotlight areas of the business that the customers are drawn to. What makes Tide Bank’s Story Highlights a fantastic example for businesses is that the Highlight titles also include emojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-tide.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover tide"                ></p><h4 id="9-Perfect-Bar"><a href="#9-Perfect-Bar" class="headerlink" title="9.Perfect Bar"></a>9.Perfect Bar</h4><p>Perfect Bar – the makers of non-GMO and organic protein bars – is another brand you can take inspiration from for creating great Insta highlight cover images. Their account has an Insta Highlight called ‘In a Nutshell’ where they answer the commonly asked questions of their customers. Every In a Nutshell session has a theme and even the older FAQ sessions are included in their Highlights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-perfect-bar.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover perfect bar"                ></p><h4 id="10-Anthropologie"><a href="#10-Anthropologie" class="headerlink" title="10.Anthropologie"></a>10.Anthropologie</h4><p>Anthropologie is one brand that does many things right. So, it’s no surprise that they have nailed their IG Story Highlights, too. What sets them apart from most other businesses are their branded Highlights, such as #AnthroHome and MyAnthro.</p><p>With the #AnthroHome Highlight, they do a few things differently. Occasionally, they have styled spaces and visitors can swipe up to directly shop the look. For their #MyAnthro Highlight, they feature fans of Anthropologie and tag their account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-anthropologie.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover anthropologie"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?</h2><p>Want to create Instagram Story Highlights under your bio on your own?

Please remember to choose the right aspect ratio for Instagram videos.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, drag and drop the video onto the <strong>Timeline</strong> for a better preview, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-instagram-video-timeline.jpg"                      alt="add instagram to filmora timeline"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If the imported media file doesn’t fit the aspect ratio on the timeline, right-click the clip and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the display to fit the video onto the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the <strong>Effect</strong> tab present on the horizontal menu.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: In the <strong>Effects</strong> tab, look for the <strong>Utility</strong> option to open an array of effects, such as <strong>Mosaic,</strong> <strong>Shape Mask, Auto Enhance, Image Mask</strong>, and <strong>Borders</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-border-effects.jpg"                      alt="filmora border effects"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: If you <em>don’t</em> see the <strong>Utility</strong> section in the <strong>Effects</strong> tab, head over to the <strong>Search</strong> bar located at the top right corner of the interface and type “<strong><em>Border”</em></strong> to find the desired effect directly.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> After locating the <strong>Border</strong> effect, tap and hold the effect to drag and drop onto the timeline, as shown in the picture below.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5.

Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories. Other also create fake accounts to conceal their real identity.</p><h2 id="6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="6.

To know if someone has viewed your Instagram story simply tap on your profile picture in the story feed and open the story you shared. Now follow these steps:</p><ul><li>At the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see “Seen by [number of views&#x2F;people who have seen the story]”</li><li>Tap on this “Seen by #” option to open your story viewers</li><li>This list contains all the people who have seen your story and tells you how many people have viewed your Instagram story</li></ul><p>A lot of people also use tools to view Instagram stories anonymously so for that you might need an Instagram story viewer app.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change"></a>Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change</h3><p>When it comes to digital platforms algorithms are the tools that determine who should see which content. These algorithms are constantly upgraded to become more relevant and effective over time.

As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them.

As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram. To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app? FollowMeter also lets you see who hasn’t followed you back, so you can go ahead and unfollow them.</p><ul><li>Utilize your Instagram account to log in to FollowMeter.</li><li>Tap Unfollowers on the Home page to unfollow people who are following you.</li><li>Go through the accounts you’ve been following and unfollow them one by one by tapping on their names in the list.</li></ul><p>When you make modifications, your Instagram account automatically updates to reflect those changes.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers"><a href="#Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers"></a>Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers</h2><p>Unfollowing you on Instagram might be for various reasons, one of which is because you followed them back.

This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles.

If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts. Don’t eat or drink anything from these people.</p><h3 id="3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog"><a href="#3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog" class="headerlink" title="3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog"></a>3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently.png"                      alt="way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently"                ></p><p>You’ll lose followers if you bombard them with photographs on a regular basis.

This photo and video sharing platform can help you reach new like-minded people, increase the sales of your products or simply share your favorite photos with the people you care about, but your Instagram posts won’t get the amount of attention they deserve if you don’t use the hidden tricks that can assist you in increasing the number of followers on your Instagram account.</p><p> Regardless of the reason why you are using Instagram, the tips featured in this article may provide assistance in mastering this platform and boosting the traffic on your account.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Money from Instagram - 2018 Ultimate Guide &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks"></a>Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks</h2><p> The key to success in life is consistency. The same can be said for Instagram since you can’t really expect to get thousands of likes on each post if you don’t add new content to your Instagram account consistently. Let’s explore Instagram’s hidden tips and tricks and see how you can enjoy even more success on this unique platform.</p><h3 id="1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches"><a href="#1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches" class="headerlink" title="1. Download videos and photos in batches"></a>1. Download videos and photos in batches</h3><p> Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://insta-downloader.net/" >Insta-downloader.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account. You just have to copy the URL of a photo or Instagram profile and click the Download button.</p><p> You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Instagram Video&#x2F;Photo Downloaders – Online &amp; Add-ons &amp; App Solutions &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Upload-photos-and-videos-from-your-computer"><a href="#2-Upload-photos-and-videos-from-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="2. Upload photos and videos from your computer"></a>2. Upload photos and videos from your computer</h3><p> The Instagram app can’t be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> You May Also Like:</p><h3 id="3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos"><a href="#3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Repost Instagram photos and videos"></a>3. Repost Instagram photos and videos</h3><p> There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn’t allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Repost app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.</p><h3 id="4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time"><a href="#4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time" class="headerlink" title="4. Post multiple photos at the same time"></a>4. Post multiple photos at the same time</h3><p> Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.</p><p> The ‘Select Multiple’ feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.</p><h3 id="5-Add-hashtags-after-posting"><a href="#5-Add-hashtags-after-posting" class="headerlink" title="5. Add hashtags after posting"></a>5. Add hashtags after posting</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram hashtags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are a powerful tool that can get your posts a lot of exposure and new followers, but they don’t work on other social media like Facebook or Twitter. That’s why you should post and share a photo or a video first, and then tap on the Edit button to add the hashtags you want to your Instagram post.</p><p> In this manner, you’ll be able to save a lot of time on deleting hashtags from the posts you shared on Facebook, Tumblr or any other social media platform.</p><h3 id="6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio"><a href="#6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio" class="headerlink" title="6. Add a URL to your bio"></a>6. Add a URL to your bio</h3><p> Featuring links to your blog or website in posts on Instagram or in comments is yet another thing you can’t do on this platform. However, if you want to direct traffic from your Instagram account to a website or a blog you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add a URL to your bio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The trick is to change the URL every time you start promoting a different project.</p><p> This tip can help you promote the products and services you’re offering on Instagram, and in addition, it can boost the conversion rates on your website, simply because more people will be able to see it.</p><h3 id="7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend"><a href="#7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend" class="headerlink" title="7. Send photos privately to a specific friend"></a>7. Send photos privately to a specific friend</h3><p> Tagging a friend in a post and having a public debate is not in accordance with everyone’s taste. Instagram however, provides the option to send a photo or a video to a friend privately. Having a private chat is a much better option if you had a more meaningful communication in mind than just exchanging a few emojis.</p><p> Furthermore, you can also send private messages to your Instagram followers by going to their profile and tapping on the Options icon that looks like three vertical black dots. Select the Send Message feature and enjoy chatting with your friends on Instagram.</p><h3 id="8-Use-Instagram-as-a-photo-editor"><a href="#8-Use-Instagram-as-a-photo-editor" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Instagram as a photo editor"></a>8. Use Instagram as a photo editor</h3><p> The photo editing features Instagram offers are truly magical, so if you need to edit a photo quickly you can use Instagram to do it. Enabling the Airplane mode will prevent the photo from being posted on your account, so before you start editing you should first switch to the Airplane mode, and make sure that the Instagram’s Save Original Photo option is activated.</p><p> Import the photo you’d like to edit to the Instagram app and apply filters or increase contrast or balance on your photo, and then proceed to share the picture. The app will report an error and inform you that the photo cannot be posted to your Instagram account, but the picture you edited will be saved in the photo gallery.</p><p> You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Best Instagram Photo Editors for 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="9-Schedule-posts-in-advance"><a href="#9-Schedule-posts-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="9. Schedule posts in advance"></a>9. Schedule posts in advance</h3><p> Social media campaigns depend on punctuality, which is the reason why scheduling Instagram posts is a strategy that might result in a better performance of your account. However, this Instagram tip works only if you have a Business profile on Instagram, and you’ll also have to get a social media scheduling tool and a HubSpot software.</p><p> The actual steps you’ll need to take in order to schedule a post depend on the social media scheduling tool you are using, so some additional research may be required before you can start scheduling your Instagram posts.</p><h3 id="10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post"><a href="#10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post" class="headerlink" title="10. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post"></a>10. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post</h3><p> If you want to, you can get notifications for each post from your friends, business associates, and influencers. Turning on notifications on Instagram is easy since all you need to do is go to the Instagram user’s profile and select the ‘Turn on Post Notifications’ options from the Settings menu. The settings icon looks like three black dots, in case you are having trouble finding it.</p><p> However, if you would like this trick to work you must allow Instagram to send you notifications in the first place. Head over to your phone’s Settings menu, select the Apps option, locate the Instagram app and choose the feature that enables notifications.</p><h3 id="11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day"><a href="#11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day" class="headerlink" title="11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day"></a>11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day</h3><p> The ephemeral content is becoming more popular every day, but some Instagram Stories deserve more attention than they can get in a single day. If you would like your Instagram Stories to stay online for longer than 24 hours you can create Story Highlights.</p><p> Simply click on the + icon below the profile picture on your Instagram account and select the stories you want to feature in the Story Highlight from the album. The Story Highlights will be visible on your Instagram profile, for as long as you want. Removing or changing the Story Highlights is a simple process that won’t take more than five minutes of your time.</p><h3 id="12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts"><a href="#12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts" class="headerlink" title="12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts"></a>12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts</h3><p> A good Instagram account is coherent because Instagrammers interested in fashion have almost zero interest in sports, so if you want to post images that cover both of these topics it is best to create different accounts. Instagram lets its users manage up to 5 interconnected accounts, which opens a plethora of opportunities for big companies that offer more than just one service as well as for up and coming startups that are looking for a big breakthrough in a certain niche.</p><p> If you want to create a new Instagram account, go to Options and tap on the Add New Account feature. You can use the same username and password for all of your Instagram accounts.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Let us know in the comments which tricks and tips we didn’t mention in this article and share with us your favorite Instagram tricks.

You have probably heard about companies getting Instagram influencers to market their products or services. Since influencers have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers, they offer companies a wide reach in these marketing campaigns. But how can you find Instagram influencers on a tight budget?</p><p> We attempt to explain the process of finding the right Instagram influencers for your niche marketing campaign.</p><h2 id="Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free"><a href="#Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free"></a>Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria"><a href="#Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Establish Your Criteria"></a>Step 1: Establish Your Criteria</h3><p> Before you go any further in the search for influencers, it is important to understand your marketing goals. Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content. You will be offering them a product or service in exchange for the branded content they will produce. And you are relying on that content being great.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers"><a href="#Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Analyze Your Followers"></a>Step 2: Analyze Your Followers</h3><p> It is surprising how many companies are able to find influencers just by looking through their own followers. Assess your Instagram account and see if you can find users who are regularly liking posts or commenting on them.</p><p> When you find users who have a high engagement on your profile, you can assess their profiles to see if any of them have high follower counts. If one or two of them have more than 10,000 followers, they could be useful to you for influencer marketing.</p><p> Even if you do not find anything through your own followers, you can always use related keyword hashtags to find influencers who are interested in the products or services that your company offers.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network"><a href="#Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Use an Influencer Network"></a>Step 3: Use an Influencer Network</h3><p> There are some very useful influencer networks that are available for free. While the free networks do not have the same analysis as paid varieties, they are still very useful in the search for Instagram influencers.</p><p> You can use an influencer network to find Instagram influencers who may have an interest in the niche that your company is targeting. All you need is a few promising leads that may be interested in talking and collaborating with your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-network.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer network"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers"><a href="#Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers"></a>Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers</h3><p> Through steps two and three, you should have been able to get at least 10 to 15 names of Instagram influencers who are interested in your niche. If you got lucky, you may have found a couple who have a serious interest in your company, making the coming talks even easier.</p><p> Most influencers will have an email address that you can use to contact them for business enquiries. Use that address to send them a formal message. If they do not have any contact method, you can always send them a direct message on Instagram to get their attention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-instagram-influencers.JPG"                      alt="contact influencer"                ></p><p> When contacting an influencer, make sure you are being very open about the invitation. Talk about your company and brand, mention the product or service you are interested in an influencer marketing, and discuss the potential budget. If you want the influencer’s help for free, make sure you are mentioning this fact in the initial message.</p><p> Do not feel disheartened if a few influencers ignore your messages. There are so many companies contacting influencers for their assistance. It is normal that some message will be ignored or lost in the shuffle.</p><p> It is why you must cast your net far and wide. Contact as many relevant influencers as you can. The more people you contact, the greater your chance of getting into a collaboration with a few influencers for free.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors"></a>Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors</h3><p> A great way to find influencers who may be interested in promoting your products or services is by looking at what your competitors are doing.</p><p> Do not focus on the most popular company in the niche, as they may be able to offer influencers better compensation.</p><p> Look at companies in the niche who have a similar size and profile to your company. You can look at all the posts where your competitors have been tagged in. These posts will show you if there are popular Instagram influencers who are advertising the products or services that your competitors are offering.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> It can be hard to find Instagram influencers for a niche marketing campaign, especially if you are working on a limited budget. But the good news is that influencers also want to raise their profile by working with brands in their niche. It can be a mutually beneficial relationship. And if your company continues to grow through the marketing you are doing with Instagram influencers, you could even establish a long term relationship with that influencer.</p><p> If you are planning
