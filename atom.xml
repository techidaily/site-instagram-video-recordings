Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded. Now at the bottom left corner, you will number of people who have viewed your story, tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step2.jpg"                      alt="methods to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now you can see the number of people who viewed your story and all those people who have viewed your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step3.jpg"                      alt="check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p>This is the easiest way of how to see who viewed your Instagram post. But if you are thinking about the images and videos that you post your feed or timeline, then you can see the number of people who viewed your post all those who liked it by following these few simple steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to any post that you want to track and see how many people have viewed and who liked it. Below your video or image, you can see ‘Liked by’. Click on the ‘others’ next to the name of the person who liked your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png"                      alt="use likes to check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.</p><p>Since this method doesn’t show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn’t provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can’t really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.</p><p>Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.</p><p>In order to start recording an Instagram story, you’ll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app’s screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch.

Well, we understand your situation. Obviously, if you have to upload your photos or videos one at a time, it may feel quite boring and frustrating, especially when you have dozens of them lined up in the queue. But here’s the good news!</p><h2 id="Introducing-Carousel"><a href="#Introducing-Carousel" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Carousel"></a>Introducing Carousel</h2><p> Instagram’s update 10.9 for Android and iOS allows its users to upload upto 10 photos and videos in one go. This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148647/16836" target="_top" id="2148647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148647/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone.

Perfect caption helps in shaping a personality and increases more followers too. Before writing Instagram captions, you need to be aware of some of the writing tips to create a strong writing base.</p><p>Here are some of the informative tips you need to keep in mind while writing Instagram captions.</p><h4 id="Be-Natural"><a href="#Be-Natural" class="headerlink" title="Be Natural"></a>Be Natural</h4><p>While thinking of any Instagram captions most important thing is to be authentic. In any kind of content try to be real and put yourself out in front of viewers. Try to be human, you don’t sound like a robot. You may feel like being extra but being natural would make more sense.</p><h4 id="Add-some-breaks-to-longer-captions"><a href="#Add-some-breaks-to-longer-captions" class="headerlink" title="Add some breaks to longer captions"></a>Add some breaks to longer captions</h4><p>Keeping short and on point, the Instagram caption is the best way of expressing yourself. But sometimes you feel like adding some extra elements and talk about a bit more too. Then you need to ensure that you are keeping some necessary breaks while writing a long caption just to make it look lighter to viewers. You don’t want to bore users by seeing at the length only right!</p><h4 id="Include-catchy-emoji"><a href="#Include-catchy-emoji" class="headerlink" title="Include catchy emoji"></a>Include catchy emoji</h4><p>Try inserting necessary emoji while writing your captions to create an appeal for your viewers. We all love emojis and adding them in an Instagram caption would make it look a little extra too.</p><h4 id="Make-use-of-the-right-hashtags"><a href="#Make-use-of-the-right-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Make use of the right hashtags"></a>Make use of the right hashtags</h4><p>Keep in mind that you want your Instagram posts to gain maximum views and make them searchable too. One of the effective ways to do that is to use relevant hashtags depending upon your Instagram post. Try to be strategic with the hashtags and add the top-rated ones to engage with more people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So Nowadays along with the picture upload adding a sparkling touch with the help of Instagram caption is the trend that you don’t want to miss trying too.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times. Setting it up is simple, the user interface is straightforward, and the Unfollower option is absolutely free of charge. Because it only works after setup, you won’t be able to see who has unfollowed you in the past.</p><p>Users may see who has unfollowed them, who has followed them, who has followed you but has not followed them back, and who has followed you but has not returned the favor. To see who unfollowed me on Instagram?, go to the Unfollowers tab and choose All.</p><h2 id="Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research"><a href="#Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research" class="headerlink" title="Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research"></a>Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research</h2><p>Our research also included various free Instagram unfollowed applications other than Followmeter. Here’s a short rundown of the very successful ones: To be on the safe side, we suggest using FollowMeter since the API and regulations for Instagram are always changing.</p><ul><li>Users and Unfollowers on Android: A Comparison (Free)</li><li>Android Followers+ (Free)</li><li>App for iOS: Followers Tracker Pro (Free)</li><li>Instagram Followers Tracker for iOS (Free)</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be"><a href="#How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be" class="headerlink" title="How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be"></a>How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be</h2><p>“Following back” is significant to some social media users because they want to be remembered. As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram. To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app? FollowMeter also lets you see who hasn’t followed you back, so you can go ahead and unfollow them.</p><ul><li>Utilize your Instagram account to log in to FollowMeter.</li><li>Tap Unfollowers on the Home page to unfollow people who are following you.</li><li>Go through the accounts you’ve been following and unfollow them one by one by tapping on their names in the list.</li></ul><p>When you make modifications, your Instagram account automatically updates to reflect those changes.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers"><a href="#Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers"></a>Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers</h2><p>Unfollowing you on Instagram might be for various reasons, one of which is because you followed them back.

This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles.

If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts.

Conversely, if you don’t publish often enough, people will assume you’re not worth following.

This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles.

Also, they have a Story Highlight termed Kitchn Pets where they post the images of adorable furry friends in the kitchen, from both their audience as well as staff members.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-kitchn.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover kitchn"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="5-Glossier-Inc"><a href="#5-Glossier-Inc" class="headerlink" title="5.Glossier Inc"></a>5.Glossier Inc</h4><p>Glossier Inc. is a people-powered beauty ecosystem. The brand uses pink color only for their profile image (not a logo). For the Highlights Covers, they use only white images. This makes their Highlights very minimalistic and very different than other accounts where product images or icons are generally used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-glossier.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover glossier"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fashion-Nova"><a href="#6-Fashion-Nova" class="headerlink" title="6.Fashion Nova"></a>6.Fashion Nova</h4><p>Fashion Nova, an international fashion brand, relies heavily on its ability to ship worldwide quickly. So, it’s not surprising that one of their Highlights is dedicated just to shipping. It seems as if some of their customers had certain shipping issues in the past. So, their Highlight uses rave reviews for showing that the issues have been solved, while simultaneously communicating to the new customers that they have lightning-fast shipping.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-fashion.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover fashion"                ></p><h4 id="7-Red-Bull"><a href="#7-Red-Bull" class="headerlink" title="7.Red Bull"></a>7.Red Bull</h4><p>Earlier, Red Bull’s IG Highlights used to be fairly conservative like projects, videos, events, etc. But, this has changed. Now their athletes have their own dedicated highlight. All one gets is a name, face, and emoji. Very intriguing, isn’t it? This is a great inspiration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-redbull.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover redbull"                ></p><h4 id="8-Tide"><a href="#8-Tide" class="headerlink" title="8.Tide"></a>8.Tide</h4><p>In their Instagram Highlights, Tide Bank uses colors that are consistent with their brand. This makes for the spotlight areas of the business that the customers are drawn to. What makes Tide Bank’s Story Highlights a fantastic example for businesses is that the Highlight titles also include emojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-tide.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover tide"                ></p><h4 id="9-Perfect-Bar"><a href="#9-Perfect-Bar" class="headerlink" title="9.Perfect Bar"></a>9.Perfect Bar</h4><p>Perfect Bar – the makers of non-GMO and organic protein bars – is another brand you can take inspiration from for creating great Insta highlight cover images. Their account has an Insta Highlight called ‘In a Nutshell’ where they answer the commonly asked questions of their customers. Every In a Nutshell session has a theme and even the older FAQ sessions are included in their Highlights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-perfect-bar.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover perfect bar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="10-Anthropologie"><a href="#10-Anthropologie" class="headerlink" title="10.Anthropologie"></a>10.Anthropologie</h4><p>Anthropologie is one brand that does many things right. So, it’s no surprise that they have nailed their IG Story Highlights, too. What sets them apart from most other businesses are their branded Highlights, such as #AnthroHome and MyAnthro.</p><p>With the #AnthroHome Highlight, they do a few things differently. Occasionally, they have styled spaces and visitors can swipe up to directly shop the look. For their #MyAnthro Highlight, they feature fans of Anthropologie and tag their account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-anthropologie.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover anthropologie"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049388/7443" target="_top" id="2049388">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049388" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049388/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?</h2><p>Want to create Instagram Story Highlights under your bio on your own?

Establish a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg"                      alt="establish a strong social media presence"                ></p><p>To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you’re posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.</p><p>But it’s not just about quantity – it’s also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers’ lives. If you can do all of that, you’ll be on your way to social media success.</p><p><strong>#2. Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6. Engage with Other Users</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg"                      alt="engage with other users"                ></p><p>You can’t just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers’ posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other’s content).</p><p><strong>#7. Post-User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg"                      alt="post-user-generated content"                ></p><p>Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don’t forget to thank them for the shoutout!</p><p><strong>#8. Collaborate with Influencers</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg"                      alt="collaborate with influencers"                ></p><p>Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.</p><p><strong>#9. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg"                      alt="share your instagram profile on other platforms"                ></p><p>Don’t forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.</p><p><strong>#10. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of instagram stories"                ></p><p>Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&amp;As with followers. And don’t forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.</p><p><strong>#11. Tag Brands in Your Posts</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg"                      alt="tag brands in your post"                ></p><p>If using products from a specific brand, don’t forget to tag them in your Instagram posts. This not only helps increase visibility for both parties, but it can also result in potential collaborations.</p><p><strong>#12. Follow the Right People</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-12.jpg"                      alt="follow the right people"                ></p><p>Follow Instagrammers in the same industry as you who post content relevant to your brand or business. This can help drive more traffic to your profile and potentially result in new followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052060/7443" target="_top" id="2052060">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052060" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052060/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>The takeaway from this article is to understand how to use the Instagram algorithm and how it works.

Hashtags enable you to discover new content, but they also provide you with an opportunity to make your posts on IGTV much easier to discover by the people who have never heard of your brand before. However, <strong>the hashtags you add to your IGTV videos</strong> have to be relevant, since there’s not much sense in using a popular hashtag that doesn’t have anything to do with the topic of your video. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to use hashtags to attract more followers and boost the number of views your videos are getting.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">The Most Popular IGTV Hashtags You Can Use in 2021</a></p><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Adding-Hashtags-to-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Adding-Hashtags-to-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos"></a>The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos</h2><p>As the second decade of the 21st century draws to a close, it is becoming apparent that the video content and more specifically mobile video is going to become even more popular than it already is. The current numbers show that as much as 90% of consumers find videos helpful when choosing a product they would like to purchase. IGTV offers a huge opportunity for marketers as it enables them to reach their ideal customers directly and to offer them products or services through video content. What’s more, the vast majority of marketers think that videos increase sales, improve engagement rates and extend the reach of their marketing messages.</p><p>IGTV is quite useful especially if you already have a sizeable following on Instagram. Hashtags simply make all content you upload to your IGTV channel easier to find, which is why you shouldn’t skip adding them to all your videos if you want to reach new followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Hashtags-on-IGTV-Successfully"><a href="#How-to-Use-Hashtags-on-IGTV-Successfully" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully"></a>How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully</h2><p>Before you choose the hashtags you would like to add to a video you intend to share on your IGTV channel, you must first do proper research in order to find which hashtags are the most popular for that type of video. There are four different hashtag categories you can choose from, and hashtags in each category serve a specific purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Content IGTV hashtags</strong> indicate what your video is about.</li><li><strong>Industry hashtags</strong> are always related to the type of business you’re running.</li><li><strong>Branded tags</strong> on IGTV refer to your brand and they can contain the name of your company or anything else that relates directly to your brand.</li><li><strong>Targeted hashtags</strong> that are directed towards the audience you would like to reach.</li></ul><p>Each video you upload to your IGTV channel is slightly different, so you should choose the hashtags you add to an IGTV video carefully. Furthermore, you can’t add more than <strong>thirty hashtags</strong> to a video description which makes picking the right hashtags even more important.</p><p>Adding hashtags to the description of your IGTV video will make that video more visible to other users of the platform and it will enable the users of this platform to easily discover the content on your channel that they are most interested in. Moreover, IGTV has a ‘For You’ category where video suggestions are displayed based on the accounts and hashtags you follow, and if you want the platform to suggest your content to its users you should include hashtags in the description of each video you upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>In addition, you can post a photo or a short version of your IGTV video on your Instagram account and use the same hashtags you used in the description of the video you posted on your IGTV channel. This is a great way to boost the number of views your IGTV videos are getting and to reach new people who can potentially become your followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="WonderShare-Filmora-A-Powerful-Tool-to-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video"><a href="#WonderShare-Filmora-A-Powerful-Tool-to-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="WonderShare Filmora - A Powerful Tool to Edit Your IGTV Video"></a>WonderShare Filmora - A Powerful Tool to Edit Your IGTV Video</h3><h4 id="Key-Features"><a href="#Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="Key Features"></a>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Keyframing: Make custom animations.</li><li>Motion Tracking: Automatic track moving object and add elements to it.</li><li>Audio Ducking: Fade your background music and make your dialogue clearer</li><li>Green Screen: Think beyond your imagination and be wherever you want.</li><li>Stocks of effects to help you create high-quality video.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049388/7443" target="_top" id="2049388">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049388" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049388/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112008/7443" target="_top" id="2112008">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112008" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112008/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Most-Popular-IGTV-Hashtags-You-Can-Use-in-2021"><a href="#The-Most-Popular-IGTV-Hashtags-You-Can-Use-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="The Most Popular IGTV Hashtags You Can Use in 2021"></a>The Most Popular IGTV Hashtags You Can Use in 2021</h2><p>Even though there are no strict rules regarding which hashtags you should and shouldn’t use, there are still a few hashtags you can include in all videos you share on IGTV. So, let’s take a look at hashtags that are currently among the most popular on IGTV.</p><p><strong>#igtv –</strong> Undoubtedly one of the most frequently used hashtags both in regular Instagram posts that promote IGTV videos and posts on IGTV. Variations of this hashtag such as #igtvchannel, #igtvcontent or #igtvcreator can also be used in all videos you add to your channel on this platform.</p><p><strong>#igtvfollow –</strong> Encourage the people who interact with your videos to start following you, by adding this hashtag to all your posts on IGTV. Alternatively, you can also use #seemyigtv or #followmyigtv hashtags to gain more followers.</p><p><strong>#igtdaily –</strong> Posting new content to your IGTV channel regularly is essential if you want to let people know that they expect a new post from you each and every day.</p><p><strong>#igtvart –</strong> In case you are producing content that is artistic in its nature, then perhaps this is one of the best hashtags you can use. Furthermore, if you are a musician you can rely on the <strong>#igtmusic</strong> hashtag to attract new followers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Even though there is nothing complicated about running a channel on IGTV, you still need to dedicate some time to figuring out how your posts can reach a large audience. <strong>Adding hashtags to your IGTV videos</strong> is probably the easiest way to increase the number of views they are getting, but hashtags can also help you to grow the number of followers organically. That is the reason why all hashtags you add to your IGTV videos have to be carefully selected, since choosing a hashtag that is no way related to your video will not produce the results you are hoping for. Do you think that using hashtags can boost the amount of attention videos on IGTV are getting? Which hashtags do you commonly use to promote the content you share on your IGTV channel?

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms. Your colonists’ lives depend on it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997635/19272" target="_top" id="1997635">  <img

Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.</p><p> We’ve gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let’s start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.</p><h2 id="Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas"><a href="#Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas"></a>Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas</h2><p> Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.</p><ul><li><strong>Cityscapes and Landscapes</strong></li></ul><p> There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don’t feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-exclusive-insight-into-the-6-most-advanced-instagram-reel-apps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exclusive Insight Into the 6 Most Advanced Instagram Reel Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-instagrams-video-talk-essentials/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Instagram's Video Talk Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-faster-than-light-instagram-video-experience-for-mobile-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Faster-Than-Light Instagram Video Experience for Mobile Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-taking-your-instagram-game-up-a-notch-advanced-tracking-tools-overview/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Taking Your Instagram Game Up a Notch Advanced Tracking Tools Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-10-best-youtube-music-reaction-videos-2023/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, 10 Best YouTube Music Reaction Videos 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-tools-for-igtv-content-creation-and-editing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Tools for IGTV Content Creation and Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-ordinary-to-extraordinary-crafting-captivating-instagram-puzzles/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Ordinary to Extraordinary Crafting Captivating Instagram Puzzles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-still-screens-to-mp3-beats-insta-video-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Still Screens to MP3 Beats - Insta Video Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-maximize-your-youtube-impact-with-perfect-aspect-ratios-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Your YouTube Impact with Perfect Aspect Ratios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unblocking-video-sharing-how-to-solve-fb-chat-issues-for-iphonesandroid/"><u>[Updated] Unblocking Video Sharing How to Solve FB Chat Issues for iPhones/Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-evaluating-and-improving-your-facebook-in-stream-ad-campaigns/"><u>2024 Approved Evaluating & Improving Your Facebook In-Stream Ad Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/essential-steps-to-switch-off-stuck-theme-on-pc/"><u>Essential Steps to Switch Off Stuck Theme on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/expert-advice-fixing-microphone-problems-in-the-steelseries-arctis-5-restoring-sound-what-to-do-when-your-steelseries-arctis-7-mic-fails-to-work/"><u>Expert Advice: Fixing Microphone Problems in the SteelSeries Arctis 5.

Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.</p><p>Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don’t allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135410/19272" target="_top" id="2135410">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135410" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135410/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Ready to try Instagram Reels?"></a>Ready to try Instagram Reels?</h3><p>Instagram reels have brought users a great opportunity of creating short yet influential videos right in the app. The ease and convenience of creating and editing videos is the reason behind its success</p><p>And, now you know all there is to know about Instagram reels.

The latest one that is garnering a lot of attention is captioning for Instagram stories and reels. This feature will let viewers watch a Story or Reel without having the need to turn on their volume. Instead, the caption will display whatever is being talked about in the short video.</p><p>This feature becomes beneficial for people who are hard of hearing. Not just this, the caption feature is also ideal for people who find an interesting Story or Reel but don’t want to disturb the people around them by turning on the volume. Instagram rolled out this feature for Stories first, and then it was launched for Reels. Now, let’s find out how to use the <strong>Instagram auto caption</strong> feature.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Captions-to-Your-Instagram-Stories-Automatically"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Captions-to-Your-Instagram-Stories-Automatically" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Captions to Your Instagram Stories Automatically?"></a>Part 1: How to Add Captions to Your Instagram Stories Automatically?</h2><p>Auto-generated captions on Instagram are easy to add. However, there’s one thing that you need to know. The caption feature is available <strong>only for English-speaking countries</strong> and not everywhere else. Therefore, if you can see the caption feature on your Instagram, it means it is available for you, and if you can’t, try updating it once. And even after updating Instagram, if you still can’t find the caption option, it means it’s not available in your country. So, the steps that we have mentioned below is for those countries that have caption feature available in their Instagram app.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, log in to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + sign. Click on the Story option and start recording something and keep talking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-story-add-caption.png"                      alt="record instagram story"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, you need to click on the emoticon option that you can see on the top of the screen.</p><p>You will see a list of stickers.
