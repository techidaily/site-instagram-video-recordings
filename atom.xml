The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration.

In order to increase the visibility of your posts on Instagram, you should strive to find the best time for sharing a post. The rule of thumb says that the best time to share a post on Instagram is when the majority of your followers is enjoying their free time because that is when they are most likely to use this social media platform. Generally speaking early mornings, lunch hours and evenings between 19:00 and 21:00 are the best times for posting on Instagram, but each year the best time for posting on Instagram changes.</p><p> Things are further complicated by the fact that each Instagram account has a unique set of followers, which means that the best time to share a post on Instagram may be different for two relatively similar accounts. In this article, we are going to show you how to find out when is the best time to post on Instagram, and we are going to recommend a few scheduling tools you are going to need if you want to make sure that your posts are always perfectly timed.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">The Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</a></li></ul><h2 id="The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>The Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-time-post-on-insta.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: mentionlytics.com</p><p> There is no recipe for success, but following certain guidelines can be useful if you want to extend the reach of your posts on Instagram. Despite the fact that social media researchers often come up with conflicting reports regarding the best time to share a post on Instagram, most of them agree that Mondays and Thursdays are the best days to post new content on Instagram.</p><p> Furthermore, several research studies suggest that Mondays are the most effective and that posts shared on this day of the week create better engagement and have better conversion rates. Thursdays, on the other hand, are the most popular day for posting content on Instagram, which suggests that your posts will have a better reach if you share them during the peak hours on this day of the week.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are no strict guidelines regarding the hours of the day, when it is best to post new content to Instagram on these days, but the time frame between 15:00 and 16:00 should be avoided during the working days of the week. Instagram’s algorithm favors posts that get a lot of likes and comments, but it also factors in the amount of time it takes a post to get those likes and comments. In this manner, the algorithm recognizes high-quality posts and shows them to even more Instagram users.</p><p> Coming up with the ways in which you can use the Instagram’s algorithm to your own advantage and discovering the best time to share a post on your account is not an exact science. However, there are certain general rules that apply to nearly all Instagrammers.</p><h3 id="The-general-rules-to-follow"><a href="#The-general-rules-to-follow" class="headerlink" title="The general rules to follow"></a>The general rules to follow</h3><ul><li><strong>Don’t forget about the time zones</strong></li></ul><p> This is a fairly simple rule that suggests that you should know your Instagram followers well enough to post for a time zone in which the majority of them lives. If your target market is in Asia or North America, then you should schedule posts for peak hours in their time zone, even if that means that you have to share posts in odd hours.</p><ul><li><strong>Share important posts on weekdays</strong></li></ul><p> Even though the differences in the engagement percentages of posts shared on weekends and weekdays are marginal, the statistics show that posts shared on Instagram on a Sunday drives less traffic than the one shared on a Wednesday or a Thursday.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t post during the working hours</strong></li></ul><p> We all lead busy lives and most of us don’t have the time for social media during the working hours. The period between 13:00h and 14:00h is a popular time for sharing posts on Instagram, but posting a photo or a video to this social media platform between 19:00 and 21:00 pm will produce the best results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals"><a href="#Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals"></a>Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals</h3><p> Finding the best time to reach your followers is going to take a certain amount of time until you finally come up with the best time to post on Instagram. Statistics can only partially help you in this endeavor since each account on Instagram is different and each company has different demographics, targets different markets and has different goals for their social media marketing campaigns.</p><p> Your own experience will tell you when the best time is to share a post on Instagram because you’ll be able to see when the posts that got the most attention were shared. Following the what the experts and their studies are saying blindly is not a good strategy because you can’ know how big the test group was or what were the findings of a study based on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p> Define your target group, and learn as much as you can about the people you are trying to reach. Who are they? Where do they live? College students have very different lifestyles than the people working 9 to 5 jobs, so an Instagram account that offers sports gear to young people will naturally have different peak time than the account that sells office equipment. The more you learn about the habits of your Instagram followers the easier it gets to find the best day and time to post on your Instagram account.</p><p> Experimenting and trying to post on Instagram at different times, will show you when the best time is to share a post on your Instagram account. Once you find the peak hours for your Instagram account, you can use tools that enable you to schedule posts. However, sharing posts at the exactly the same time every day can be counterproductive, so in order to ensure the growth of your Instagram account, keep an open mind and try out new things from time to time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135363/19272" target="_top" id="2135363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135363/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram"></a>The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</h2><p> Recently, Instagram has introduced the Schedule option that allows you to schedule posts in advance directly from the platform.

Here is another bonus section regarding tips on vertical videos for Instagram in addition to the video specs. Read through them as we have covered how to make vertical videos stunning for Instagram.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Be specific to vertical</strong></p><p>Why get worked up by shooting the video in Landscape and cropping them? To make it a hassle-free task so that you can share the video on multiple platforms like Facebook and YouTube, you can turn your camera upright on your smartphone and shoot the vertical footage for the best results. Doing so will let you complete control over the screen to fill the whole frame for a better viewing experience. If on camera, you can rotate it to 90 degrees.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Post-produce edit from horizontal to vertical</strong></p><p>Is the video already shot horizontally on your camera or smartphone? No worries, as you can edit them to the desired aspect ratio from 16:9 to 9:16 with the assistance of software like iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, and other third-party applications like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a>. This tactic’s only challenge is that you need to be ready to crop the left and right sides of the shot or recorded video, and do not forget that the concept needs to be centralized!</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Crop to reveal details</strong></p><p>Vertical video is a great option to showcase wide and tall subjects where you can place close-ups and show off details to get up close and personal. It could be a product or fabric. You can showcase enticing minor elements that attract an audience in such landscape shots.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hence, I am sure you found new tactics to create vertical videos for Instagram.

Without much ado, let’s proceed and learn how to put music on IG story in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ig-logo.jpg"                      alt=" Instagram Logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Adding-Music-to-IG-Story"><a href="#A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Adding-Music-to-IG-Story" class="headerlink" title="A Step-by-step Guide for Adding Music to IG Story"></a>A Step-by-step Guide for Adding Music to IG Story</h2><p>To make it easier for us to post interesting stories, Instagram has come up with the Music feature. Using it, we can look for tons of popular songs in different languages and add our favorite snippets to our story. Presently, the feature of Instagram Music is available for English, German, French, Hindi, and a few other local languages. Also, you can post a snippet of at most 15 seconds since that is the maximum duration of an Instagram story. To learn how to add music to the IG story, you can follow these simple steps right away:</p><h4 id="1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story"><a href="#1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Select the Music feature for IG story"></a>1. Select the Music feature for IG story</h4><p>To start with, just launch the Instagram application on your phone and tap on the “Add Story” button. You can find it on the top-left corner of the screen, depicted by a “+” sign with your profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-story.jpg"                      alt=" Add Story Button"                ></p><p>This will launch a dedicated interface for Instagram Story. Here, you can use your camera to click a picture or record a mini video. If you want, you can also upload an existing picture or video as your story as well. Once you have taken a snap, just scroll up your screen to get various add-on features for your story. From here, just tap on the “Music” option to add music to IG story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-music.jpg"                      alt=" Add Music"                ></p><h4 id="2-Select-any-song-of-your-choice"><a href="#2-Select-any-song-of-your-choice" class="headerlink" title="2. Select any song of your choice"></a>2. Select any song of your choice</h4><p>As of now, Instagram music has an extensive catalog with millions of songs in different languages and genres. As you would tap on the “Music” option, it will automatically suggest numerous songs that are trending. If you want, you can tap on the search bar and enter keywords for songs, artists, albums, etc. to look for anything specific.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-taylor-swift-songs.jpg"                      alt=" Select Taylor Swift Songs"                ></p><p>Once you find the song of your choice, just tap on it and it will be loaded on the Instagram Story interface. Although the entire song would be loaded, you would now have to clip a snippet of at most 15 seconds from it. There is a slider at the bottom that you can move and adjust to clip the specific part and even view its lyrics sliding as you move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-lyrics.jpg"                      alt=" View Lyrics"                ></p><h4 id="3-Make-optional-edits-to-customize-the-story"><a href="#3-Make-optional-edits-to-customize-the-story" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though, a lot of people would like to make changes in the story to make it look presentable. For instance, you can see a timer (that is set to 15 seconds by default) at the bottom-left panel. Just tap on it and adjust the duration for your story that can be anywhere from 2 to 15 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-story.jpg"                      alt=" Edit IG Story"                ></p><p>After when you add music to IG story, you can further change how it looks. You can see different ways to display the lyrics right above the snippet selection. If you want, you can zoom in or out the text and move it to display it the way you like. Furthermore, there is a color radiant option on the top that you can select to change the text color and background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-story.jpg"                      alt=" Customize IG Story"                ></p><p>If you don’t want to display the lyrics, then just swipe the text options at the bottom and select the sticker feature. This will only display the sticker of the track on the story. You can also tap on the sticker to get different display options for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/display-options-of-music.jpg"                      alt=" Display Options of IG Story Music"                ></p><h4 id="4-Post-your-IG-Story-on-your-Profile"><a href="#4-Post-your-IG-Story-on-your-Profile" class="headerlink" title="4.

To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. Inflact:"></a>5. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/" >Inflact: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools.

To fix it, you should clear the cache.</p><p>Here’s how you can do this:</p><ol><li>Open your Steam client.

Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016129/19272" target="_top" id="2016129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016129/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming.

The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.</p><p> The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4.

These followers are somehow interested in your personality, posts, or what you show on your Instagram account. So, if you are an Instagram influencer, you would want to prevent people from unfollowing you. The best is by maintaining their expectations and hopes with your account. The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:</p><ul><li><strong>Going Live</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Active</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there’s a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with audience</strong></li></ul><p>Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers. Otherwise, they would think that you are rude and will start unfollowing you. Also, try to engage on their posts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking"></a>FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking</h3><h4 id="1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?"></a>1. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?</h4><p>The obvious answer to this question is no. Instagram does not notify if someone has unfollowed you due to any reason. Instagram tends to keep its user’s privacy, and also it is against the application’s privacy policy. But if you still want to know, you can either check manually or use a third-party app.</p><h4 id="2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram"><a href="#2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you don’t want to interact with someone or see their posts or stories, then it is mature to unfollow them for good. But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.</p><h4 id="3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts"><a href="#3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts" class="headerlink" title="3.

Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world. It was a huge hit right away, with over a million users only two months after it went up. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger created Instagram in San Francisco.</p><p>Instagram was started on October 6, 2010, and it grew almost instantly. From a small number of users, it quickly grew to become the most popular photography app, with 100,000 users in one week and one million in two months. According to Kevin Systrom, the software took only eight weeks to develop yet was the culmination of a year’s worth of work. Facebook eventually purchased it for $1 billion in 2012. It now has over 600 million active users and continues to grow rapidly.</p><h4 id="How-Many-People-Can-You-Video-Chat-With"><a href="#How-Many-People-Can-You-Video-Chat-With" class="headerlink" title="How Many People Can You Video Chat With?"></a>How Many People Can You Video Chat With?</h4><p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users regularly.

Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there.

This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced-3"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced-3" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world.

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos"></a>7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts"></a>9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts</h4><p>There is something strangely satisfying about watching others open gifts or things they got in the mail. This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?
