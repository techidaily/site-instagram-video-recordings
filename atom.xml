These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</h2><p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share. You need to click on the not interesting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-options.jpg"                      alt="click on not interested on suggested posts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That post and user will be removed, and instead of that, you will see a message by Instagram asking for feedback. You can click on the option: I don’t want to see posts from this account, and Instagram won’t show you that user’s posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-feedback.jpg"                      alt="choose your feedback option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975503">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975503">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975503.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975503%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975503/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now, you can apply the same steps for the rest of the posts as well. But do keep in mind that suggested posts will still appear.

You can do it by using your web browser or Instagram mobile app. Whichever is comfortable to use. However, please note that these steps have to be followed for each suggested user. Now, please use that and then follow these steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037345/7443" target="_top" id="2037345">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037345" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037345/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="For-Instagram-app-users"><a href="#For-Instagram-app-users" class="headerlink" title="For Instagram app users"></a>For Instagram app users</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to open your Instagram account on your handset.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start looking at your Instagram feed. After one or two posts, you will see the Suggestions for You feature. Take a look at the screenshot to understand better.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, on top of every suggestion for you, you will see the x mark. That’s what you need to click on that. Ensure you are doing that for every suggestion that appears on your home feed. After clicking on the X, that account will not be suggested to you, and it will disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-instagram-suggestion-post.jpg"                      alt="click on x symbol to delete suggested users"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To delete multiple suggested users, just click on the see all option, and the list of suggested users will appear; now click on the X for each user you want to delete. However, you need to delete everyone one by one individually.</p><h3 id="For-web-browsers"><a href="#For-web-browsers" class="headerlink" title="For web browsers"></a>For web browsers</h3><p>The problem with web browsers is that you won’t be able to remove the suggested users like you can through your Instagram app on your Android or iOS devices. So, the only way out for you will be to open your Instagram mobile app and then do it from there by following the steps that we have mentioned for Instagram app users.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List"></a>Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List</h2><p>Just like Instagram show you suggested users and posts, your account gets recommended to others as well. This is done so that your account can be followed by people who may be interested in your content. If you don’t want to get suggested by Instagram, then here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a web browser and visit Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, look at the top right, where you can see your profile picture. Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section. In this section, you will see a checkbox. You need to uncheck that if you don’t want your name to appear as a suggested user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncheck-similar-account-suggestions.jpg"                      alt=" uncheck the similar account suggestions box"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work"><a href="#Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?"></a>Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</h2><p>Instagram takes note of everything that you do online. From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-closing-your-vlog-right-top-6-free-youtube-outro-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, Closing Your Vlog Right Top 6 Free YouTube Outro Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-top-10-apps-to-excitingly-edit-horizontal-and-vertical-igtv-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 10 Apps to Excitingly Edit Horizontal and Vertical IGTV for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-your-profile-with-high-quality-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Your Profile With High-Quality Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-executing-the-last-goodbye-to-your-instagram-account-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Executing the Last Goodbye to Your Instagram Account for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-highlighting-the-leading-10-shadowy-story-viewers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Highlighting the Leading 10 Shadowy Story Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-flip-to-impress-the-instagram-video-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Flip to Impress The Instagram Video Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-zoom-from-novice-to-expert-configurator/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Zoom From Novice to Expert Configurator</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/comedy-and-emotions-the-cutest-instagram-meme-groups-for-2024/"><u>Comedy & Emotions The Cutest Instagram Meme Groups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-cleanse-your-computer-of-previous-security-audits/"><u>How to Cleanse Your Computer of Previous Security Audits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-compreomed-approach-for-making-tiktok-songs-your-ringtone/"><u>In 2024, A Compreomed Approach for Making TikTok Songs Your Ringtone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-does-the-stardust-trade-cost-in-pokemon-go-on-oppo-f23-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How does the stardust trade cost In pokemon go On Oppo F23 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-rank-your-facebook-page/"><u>In 2024, How to Rank Your Facebook Page</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-igtv-and-how-to-use-it-everything-you-need-to-know/"><u>In 2024, What Is IGTV and How to Use It Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-8-stellar-alternatives-to-windows-10-photos-for-enhanced-photography-experience-for-2024/"><u>Updated 8 Stellar Alternatives to Windows 10 Photos for Enhanced Photography Experience for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1.

Until recently Instagram was a platform that was mainly dedicated to photos because the duration of the videos you could upload to your account was limited to just sixty seconds. All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload videos that last up to one hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV"><a href="#How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="How to Get More Followers on IGTV?"></a>How to Get More Followers on IGTV?</h2><p> Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers"></a>1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform.

A watermark can easily ruin that balance without a good reason since it will hardly prevent someone who decided to steal your work from actually doing it.</p><p><strong>Watermarks are easily removed:</strong> Don’t think for a second that anyone with only a basic level of Photoshop skills, can’t crop or clone stamp a watermark from a photo. Unless you intend to place a watermark over an entire image, like stock photography websites do, but even then removing a watermark is far from impossible.</p><p><strong>You won’t look like a pro:</strong> A watermark will not make you look more professional than you already are, the quality of your photos will. Although photographers sign their prints all the time, a watermark can make you look bad in the eyes of the Instagram’s community because you’ll look like you think that your work is so good that everyone is going to try to steal it. Be humble, there are other ways of proving that you own the copyrights to a photo, like keeping the RAW file safely stored on your computer’s hard-drive or including the copyright information in the photo’s metadata.</p><p><strong>Your photos will look like they’ve been edited:</strong> With all the photo effects Instagram offers and all the photo editing options that are available to photographers, straight-out-of-camera pictures will earn you much more respect from the community on Instagram, than photos that are clearly edited. A watermark can often make people think that the picture has been edited since the photographer took the time to design and add a watermark to a photo.</p><p><strong>Adding watermarks will not make you famous:</strong> At first, it may seem like a good idea to use watermarks for the promotion of your business, but most Instagram users don’t really read the names on the watermarks. Strive to produce photos that will make the viewers want to know everything there is to know about you because the quality of your photos is the best advertisement you can get.</p><h2 id="Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips"><a href="#Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips"></a>Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips</h2><p>If, despite all this, you would still like to add a watermark to your Instagram photos, here are a few tips that will help you avoid making mistakes that can be harmful to the success of your images on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Use monochrome watermarks:</strong> Tastefully designed watermarks, that don’t feature too many colors, will serve its purpose, and they will not distract the viewer of a photo too much. A minimalistic approach to watermark design is probably the best, less is more, so use fewer colors in order to achieve better results.</p><p><strong>Place the watermarks around the edges of a photo:</strong> As we already mentioned, adding new visual elements to photos creates all sorts of problems, but if you really want to watermark your photos, at least try to place them on the edges of a photo where they won’t attract too much attention.</p><p><strong>Vertically oriented watermarks create less distraction:</strong> This is a great way to distract the viewer as little as possible while keeping the watermark on your photo clearly visible and readable. If you place a vertically oriented watermark near the edge of a photo, the spectator has a better chance of seeing a photo, before realizing that it has a watermark.</p><p><strong>Carefully choose the font and its size:</strong> Use simple fonts. There is no reason to utilize kitschy fonts that are not easily readable because it isn’t likely that the viewer of a photo is going to spend time on figuring out what the watermark says. Don’t let the watermark become the first thing your Instagram followers see on a photo because they will most probably just keep scrolling without spending a second to figure out what your photo really is about.</p><h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos</h2><h4 id="1-eZy-Watermark-Lite"><a href="#1-eZy-Watermark-Lite" class="headerlink" title="1. eZy Watermark Lite"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ezy-watermark-lite-photo/id494473910?mt=8" >eZy Watermark Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                                     ></p><p>More than 2 million downloads prove that eZy Watermark Lite is one of the best iPhone apps for adding watermarks at the App Store.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for.

As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now.

What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program.

It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.</p><p>On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over. So, be very careful about that and don’t follow a niche that is trending, rather build what interests you.

As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can’t really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.</p><p>Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.</p><p>In order to start recording an Instagram story, you’ll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app’s screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch.

Although rather controversial, the editing available from this little app is truly out of this world, with nothing else in the market quite matching it for selfie tuning. It costs $3.99 to download, but there are no more purchases to make once you’ve bought the software.</p><p>From a standard portrait, you can add make up, reduce wrinkles, sweep highlight over your cheeks or make your eyelashes look fuller. Enhance your cheekbones, straighten your nose, fill in patchy eyebrows and get an instant tooth whitening treatment… there’s really not much that this can’t improve on a face. If Instagram selfies are your thing, this is one to have a play with.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facetune/id606310581?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.facetune" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There are many more Instagram photo editor app choices out there, so do take a look around and see what suits your needs the best. Do watch out for ‘free’ editing apps which have a rapidly approaching paywall; these we have mentioned here are perfectly functional without additional payment, but there are others which may not be as free as they first seem.</p><h3 id="Instagram-photo-editor-online"><a href="#Instagram-photo-editor-online" class="headerlink" title="Instagram photo editor online"></a>Instagram photo editor online</h3><p>If you prefer to use your PC to edit your photos, then there are plenty of options in the online world too. Here are five of the best Instagram photo editor options from the web.</p><h4 id="1-Canva"><a href="#1-Canva" class="headerlink" title="1. Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap"><a href="#5-piZap" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Spark Post"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/" >Adobe Spark Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>From the photo geniuses (genii?) at Adobe comes this easy to use, fun and free photo editor, perfect for Instagram-worthy compositions. Choose from a selection of templates or start from scratch, and add filters, layers and beautiful text to anything.</p><p>It’s all free, although businesses might want to consider upgrading to the paid version, as this allows the removal of the Adobe Spark logo from your posts. It also gives live phone and chat support and the options for branded templates, and costs just $10 a month with no ongoing commitment.</p><p>Most of these online Instagram photo editors have been designed to work with all major browsers, including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge. However, if you’re having problems getting them to work on your PC or tablet, do try them in another browser as there have been some conflictions reported.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049378/7443" target="_top" id="2049378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There you have our pick of the best Instagram photo editor apps and online services, many of which are completely free to use.

Its price suggests the same, since the cheapest version of Sprout Social you can get costs $99, while the most expensive option for enterprises costs $249.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139113/17108" target="_top" id="2139113">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139113" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139113/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-brand-identity-in-pictures-how-to-watermark-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] Brand Identity in Pictures How to Watermark on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/n-2024-elevating-your-style-with-youtubes-best-hauls/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevating Your Style with YouTube's Best Hauls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-online-gif-video-converters/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Online GIF Video Converters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unlock-additional-instagram-filters-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Unlock Additional Instagram Filters A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-date-counting-tools-for-android-and-ios-users/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Date-Counting Tools for Android and iOS Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-digital-documentation-mobile-and-desktop-meeting-recordings/"><u>2024 Approved Digital Documentation Mobile & Desktop Meeting Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-complexities-of-youtubes-subtitles-download-with-3-proven-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating the Complexities of YouTube's Subtitles Download With 3 Proven Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-striking-visuals-that-move-us-top-20-instagram-photos/"><u>2024 Approved Striking Visuals that Move Us Top 20 Instagram Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/guide-to-perfectly-fit-your-content-in-instagram-feed/"><u>Guide to Perfectly Fit Your Content in Instagram Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-lava-yuva-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Lava Yuva 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-guide-to-add-fun-filters-and-graphics-to-your-snapchat-story/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide to Add Fun Filters and Graphics to Your Snapchat Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-triigers.techidaily.com/navigating-project-specifications-the-importance-of-the-requirements-tab/"><u>Navigating Project Specifications: The Importance of the Requirements Tab</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-animate-your-world-8-must-try-video-animation-apps-for-mobile/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Animate Your World 8 Must-Try Video Animation Apps for Mobile</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastermind-Your-Marketing-Surge-to-1-000-Insta-Supporters-Each-Month"><a href="#Mastermind-Your-Marketing-Surge-to-1-000-Insta-Supporters-Each-Month" class="headerlink" title="Mastermind Your Marketing: Surge to 1,000 Insta Supporters Each Month"></a>Mastermind Your Marketing: Surge to 1,000 Insta Supporters Each Month</h2><p>If you want to be a successful Instagrammer, you need to have many followers. But don’t worry – you don’t have to resort to shady tactics to get more followers. There are several things you can do that are both easy and effective.</p><p>This post will outline 12 of the best ways to get 1,000 followers every month on Instagram.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram"></a>How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram</h2><ol><li>Establish a Strong Social Media Presence.</li><li>Optimize Your Profile.</li><li>Know your audience.</li><li>Post at the right time of day.</li><li>Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</li><li>Engage with Other Users</li><li>Post-User-Generated Content</li><li>Collaborate with Influencers</li><li>Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</li><li>Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</li><li>Tag Brands in Your Posts</li><li>Follow the Right People</li></ol><p>So read on and start growing your following today!</p><p><strong>#1. Establish a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg"                      alt="establish a strong social media presence"                ></p><p>To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you’re posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.</p><p>But it’s not just about quantity – it’s also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers’ lives. If you can do all of that, you’ll be on your way to social media success.</p><p><strong>#2. Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6. Engage with Other Users</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg"                      alt="engage with other users"                ></p><p>You can’t just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers’ posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other’s content).</p><p><strong>#7. Post-User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg"                      alt="post-user-generated content"                ></p><p>Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don’t forget to thank them for the shoutout!</p><p><strong>#8. Collaborate with Influencers</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg"                      alt="collaborate with influencers"                ></p><p>Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.</p><p><strong>#9. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg"                      alt="share your instagram profile on other platforms"                ></p><p>Don’t forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.</p><p><strong>#10. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of instagram stories"                ></p><p>Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&amp;As with followers. And don’t forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.</p><p><strong>#11. Tag Brands in Your Posts</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg"                      alt="tag brands in your post"                ></p><p>If using products from a specific brand, don’t forget to tag them in your Instagram posts. This not only helps increase visibility for both parties, but it can also result in potential collaborations.</p><p><strong>#12. Follow the Right People</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-12.jpg"                      alt="follow the right people"                ></p><p>Follow Instagrammers in the same industry as you who post content relevant to your brand or business. This can help drive more traffic to your profile and potentially result in new followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>The takeaway from this article is to understand how to use the Instagram algorithm and how it works.
