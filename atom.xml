Finally, the users of one of the largest social networks ever created can post videos that last longer than sixty seconds, although there are a number of limitations. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Uploading a video to Instagram TV, or IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a straightforward process, but at the moment you can only add vertically oriented videos to your IGTV channel. That’s why we’ve decided to show you several quick and easy ways of resizing and rotating your videos so that each video you share on IGTV fits the platform’s demands perfectly.</p><h3 id="Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine"><a href="#Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine" class="headerlink" title="Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine"></a>Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine</h3><p>Recently, video marketing has become an unstoppable trend. Celebrities and businesses earn great fortune through high-quality marketing videos. To join the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >profitable video marketing era <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can create your own IGTV marketing videos now!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-marketing-videos.png"                      alt="create marketing videos"                ></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos?

[PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]"></a>Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos? [PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]</h2><p>At the moment, IGTV only supports videos with aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 to 9:16</strong>, so if you recorded a video in any other aspect ratio you will have to change it before you share it on your IGTV channel. Moreover, the maximum size of a video file that lasts up to ten minutes is limited to just <strong>650MB</strong>, and the chances are that you will have to change the file’s size in order to be able to upload it to IGTV. Let’s have a look at some of the most effective ways of reformatting your IGTV videos.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers"><a href="#Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers"></a>Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers</h4><p>Changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of a video file in Filmora is easy. After you launch Wondershare’s video editor, you’ll have the option to <strong>create a new project</strong> or continue working on a project you already created. Once Filmora’s main window appears on the screen you just have to go to the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.</p><p>You can then change the resolution or choose a different frame rate. It is best to pick the <strong>1080X1920 (9:16 Portrait) option</strong> since the files exported in 2160X3840 (9:16 Portrait) resolution can end up being too large for the IGTV platform. Click on the OK button to confirm the adjustments you’ve made, and proceed to edit your video.</p><p>In case the process of changing a video’s aspect ratio and resolution is too complicated for you, Filmora offers an even simpler way of reformatting footage. Simply <strong>import a video</strong> into the video editor, and then <strong>place it on a video track on the timeline</strong>. <strong>Right-click on the file</strong> and select the <strong>Crop and Zoom option</strong> from the menu, or alternatively, just use the left mouse click to select a video you added to the timeline and use the <strong>Alt+C keyboard shortcut</strong> to access the <strong>Crop and Zoom window</strong>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ratio drop-down menu</strong> and choose the <strong>9:16 option</strong>, and then <strong>position the Crop rectangle over the area of the video you’d like to keep</strong>. Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

Once the camera opens up, click on the Story option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-story.jpg"                      alt="create Instagram Story"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You need to browse through the filters and click on the search option, and then search for Voice Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-voice-effects.jpg"                      alt=" Instagram Story voice effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Voice Effects option. The filter icon will be pink. Please click on that. The Voice Effect filter will be added, and then you can start recording a story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-story-change-voice.jpg"                      alt="change Instagram Story video voice"                ></p><p>Preview your story, and you will see that your voice has been changed to the chosen Voice Effect.

As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.</p><p>Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!</p><p><strong>Vocalist:</strong> The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.</p><p><strong>Announcer:</strong> The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!</p><p><strong>Robot:</strong> The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?"></a>Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?</h2><p>Just like you can change your voice when filming a story, you can try the same voice-changing filter while recording a reel.

Each platform is slightly different, so you can’t use the same information when sharing a post on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV. However, the videos you share on your IGTV channel can benefit quite a bit from simple things like a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video title, a description of a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a cover photo. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of creating and changing an IGTV cover photo.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</li><li>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</li><li>Part 3: Bonus! Edit Your IGTV Video with Filmora</li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV"><a href="#Part-1-Dimensions-and-Specifications-for-Cover-Photos-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV"></a>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</h2><p>IGTV is centered around the idea that people hold their phones vertically while watching videos, and for that reason, all videos on this platform are in the <strong>9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. Hence the cover photos you can add to your IGTV videos have to be <strong>vertically oriented</strong> as well, and if you would like to prevent IGTV from cropping your cover photo, you need to make sure that the picture matches the platform’s specifications. If you follow these specifications the cover photos for your IGTV videos are going to look equally good inside the IGTV app, the Instagram.com website, Instagram app search grid or Instagram app search feed.</p><p>YouTuber The K Guy has made a video to demonstrate the IGTV Cover Thumbnail size and dimensions and safe zone. You can check the video tutorial below.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to make thumbnails with an online thumbnail maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The images you use as cover photos for your videos will be displayed in different aspect ratios depending on the device that is used to view them. You can use a picture that has <strong>1080X1680</strong> pixels, <strong>a near 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>, as a cover photo for all IGTV videos you upload to your channel or you can choose to work with smaller images that <strong>have 420X654 pixels and a 1:1.55 aspect ratio.</strong> If you upload a cover photo that has <strong>1080X1920 pixels</strong> the platform will automatically <strong>crop approximately 120 pixels</strong> from both shorter and longer sides of the image. The size of a file you’re using for an IGTV video cover photo cannot exceed <strong>4MB,</strong> and the file must be saved as <strong>a JPEG</strong> since presently this is the only picture file format supported by IGTV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/igtv-cover-photo-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="IGTV Cover Photo Safe Zone "                ></p><p>While creating a cover photo for an IGTV video you need to keep in mind that different graphics and text overlays are going to be displayed over the picture once you upload it to your channel. During the process of uploading IGTV video’s cover photo, you will be able to add text to it, but the <strong>Title Safe Area</strong> suggests where you can place the text without the risk of it being cropped while being viewed from different devices won’t be shown. So, make sure that all text you add to your IGTV video cover photo is <strong>placed in the central area of the image</strong> in order for it to be clearly visible on all devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</h2><p>Adding a cover photo to your IGTV video is easy since you just have <strong>to upload a photo from your camera roll or from a video.</strong> After adding a title of a video and a description you can simply tap on <strong>the Edit Cover option</strong> and select either <strong>Upload from Camera Roll or Choose Cover from Video</strong> options and proceed to pick the image you want to upload. In case you choose to add a picture from a video you will be able to navigate to the exact point in the video where the still frame you’d like to use a cover photo is located. The picture will be automatically added as your cover photo as soon as you confirm the changes.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Photo editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iPhones and Android</strong> devices can help you create captivating cover photos for your IGTV videos, but you can also edit your IGTV cover photos with the image editor that is available in Instagram Stories.

Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video.

After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded. Now at the bottom left corner, you will number of people who have viewed your story, tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step2.jpg"                      alt="methods to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now you can see the number of people who viewed your story and all those people who have viewed your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step3.jpg"                      alt="check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p>This is the easiest way of how to see who viewed your Instagram post. But if you are thinking about the images and videos that you post your feed or timeline, then you can see the number of people who viewed your post all those who liked it by following these few simple steps.</p><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to any post that you want to track and see how many people have viewed and who liked it. Below your video or image, you can see ‘Liked by’. Click on the ‘others’ next to the name of the person who liked your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png"                      alt="use likes to check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.</p><p>Since this method doesn’t show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn’t provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

Vertical Video is necessary"></a>1. Vertical Video is necessary</h3><p> For Instagram TV (IGTV), it is important to have vertical videos. The old YouTube horizontal videos need you to rotate your screen to watch them properly. Fix the 1080X1920 pixels dimensions as that of Instagram Stories for IGTV videos. You can alternatively stick to the 9.16 aspect ratio for these IGTV vertical videos.</p><h3 id="2-Keep-It-Short"><a href="#2-Keep-It-Short" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep It Short"></a>2. Keep It Short</h3><p> Just because you have got a video limit of 10 minutes doesn’t mean you will pester the channel with anything and everything without bothering about the video length. Always keeping it short works, as people rarely stay interested beyond the initial 3-4 minutes of a video. Unless you belong to the film industry and have HD quality videos with breathtaking content don’t rush to post 30-40 minutes long ones. Anything between 2 to 5 minutes is worth.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Just-Repost-videos"><a href="#3-Don’t-Just-Repost-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Just Repost videos"></a>3. Don’t Just Repost videos</h3><p> Unlike Instagram Stories, IGTV content is going to stay there beyond the 24 hours.

Finally, the users of one of the largest social networks ever created can post videos that last longer than sixty seconds, although there are a number of limitations. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Uploading a video to Instagram TV, or IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a straightforward process, but at the moment you can only add vertically oriented videos to your IGTV channel. That’s why we’ve decided to show you several quick and easy ways of resizing and rotating your videos so that each video you share on IGTV fits the platform’s demands perfectly.</p><h3 id="Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine"><a href="#Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine" class="headerlink" title="Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine"></a>Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine</h3><p>Recently, video marketing has become an unstoppable trend.

To join the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >profitable video marketing era <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can create your own IGTV marketing videos now!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-marketing-videos.png"                      alt="create marketing videos"                ></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos?

[PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]"></a>Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos? [PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]</h2><p>At the moment, IGTV only supports videos with aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 to 9:16</strong>, so if you recorded a video in any other aspect ratio you will have to change it before you share it on your IGTV channel. Moreover, the maximum size of a video file that lasts up to ten minutes is limited to just <strong>650MB</strong>, and the chances are that you will have to change the file’s size in order to be able to upload it to IGTV. Let’s have a look at some of the most effective ways of reformatting your IGTV videos.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers"><a href="#Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers"></a>Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers</h4><p>Changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of a video file in Filmora is easy. After you launch Wondershare’s video editor, you’ll have the option to <strong>create a new project</strong> or continue working on a project you already created. Once Filmora’s main window appears on the screen you just have to go to the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.</p><p>You can then change the resolution or choose a different frame rate. It is best to pick the <strong>1080X1920 (9:16 Portrait) option</strong> since the files exported in 2160X3840 (9:16 Portrait) resolution can end up being too large for the IGTV platform. Click on the OK button to confirm the adjustments you’ve made, and proceed to edit your video.</p><p>In case the process of changing a video’s aspect ratio and resolution is too complicated for you, Filmora offers an even simpler way of reformatting footage. Simply <strong>import a video</strong> into the video editor, and then <strong>place it on a video track on the timeline</strong>. <strong>Right-click on the file</strong> and select the <strong>Crop and Zoom option</strong> from the menu, or alternatively, just use the left mouse click to select a video you added to the timeline and use the <strong>Alt+C keyboard shortcut</strong> to access the <strong>Crop and Zoom window</strong>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ratio drop-down menu</strong> and choose the <strong>9:16 option</strong>, and then <strong>position the Crop rectangle over the area of the video you’d like to keep</strong>. Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

But, simply setting a goal doesn’t work until you set a target for success.</p><p> How much do you wish to achieve and what does success look to you? Once you have it clear in your mind, you can start measuring how much you have achieved from the set campaign and how long you need to go further.</p><p> It must be clear in your mind whether you want followers from the campaign or need traffic to your site and conversions. Whatever it is, you must set a clear goal so that your campaign is executed properly and improved when required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insta-set-goal.JPG"                      alt="instagram influencer marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Find-Right-Instagram-Influencer"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Right-Instagram-Influencer" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Right Instagram Influencer"></a>Step 2: Find Right Instagram Influencer</h3><p> Do you need a big influencer for a huge audience or a micro influencer to obtain the trust of the small set of audience?</p><p> Before you decide on the size, you need to be sure of the relevance of the influencer to your business and brand. The content of the influencers, you work with, must be relevant to your industry.</p><p> But, the influencer often depends on your campaign too. You must also check the engagement rate created by the influencer as it reveals how much the audience loves to interact with or loves the style of the influencer.</p><p> Once you build a relationship with your ideal influencer on Instagram, generating high quality leads is vital for an Instagram Influencer Marketing campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-right-insta-influencer.JPG"                      alt="find influencer"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Reach-Out-Influencers"><a href="#Step-3-Reach-Out-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Reach Out Influencers"></a>Step 3: Reach Out Influencers</h3><p> Do you have an assumption that influencers will work just because you are remunerating them? Then, you are completely wrong as the influencers only promote your product if they believe in it.</p><p> As the influencers are picky, it is good for your brand value. Your first impression and the pitching process must be good with your influencer. You may send them a mail with your brief introduction or directly message them introducing your brand and how much you like the motivational messages from the influencer.</p><p> This is a positive way of discussing things and still, if your ideal influencer declines your messages, you may thank them and ask them to connect with you any time they like.

No one ever likes to pay more than the desired but you would also not like to offer peanuts. The budget depends on the size and value of your company. It depends on how much you can shell out and what is the value you can obtain from the Influencer.</p><p> According to the survey, an average influencer charges around $271. The influencers with a minimum following have better rates of engagement than the influencer with a huge audience base.</p><p> The influencer with a bigger following cannot be completely ignored. But, the micro-influencers have lower rates than the big influencers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/budget-video-service.JPG"                      alt="budget instagram influencer marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-5-Calculate-ROI"><a href="#Step-5-Calculate-ROI" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Calculate ROI"></a>Step 5: Calculate ROI</h3><p> Is the Instagram influencer marketing reaping in profits?

The only solution to this issue is to crop the video and change its aspect ratio so it fits one of the commonly used aspect ratios on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download Filmora and Import the file into the software</strong></p><p>In order to start cropping your videos, you first must install the Filmora video editing software on your computer. Open the video editor in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, and then click on the Import drop-down menu and select the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Drag and Drop the video file onto the Timeline</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Now that the video clip you want to edit is in the editor’s media library, drag it and drop it to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop videos for Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>1. Landscape (16:9)</strong></p><p>Chances are that the camera you used to record your video clip recorded the footage in the landscape aspect ratio. Before you can export your video clip, you must first check the resolution and frame rate of the clip you want to export. Right-click on the clip in the media panel and select Properties. After you found out this information, click on the Export button located just below the media panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="check aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Once the new window appears, you should click on the Format icon positioned in the upper left corner of the screen. Select the MP4 format, name your file and select the folder where the file will be exported.</p><p>Click on the Settings button and then set the Quality of the video to Best and select the HD Optimized option in the Encoder menu. Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio. Once you made the calculations return to Filmora and click on the Manually option in the Crop and Pan screen. Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-convert-instagram-video-to-mp4-2-proven-ways/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Convert Instagram Video to MP4 [ 2 Proven Ways]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-eluding-digital-footprints-while-enjoying-instagram-stories-online-for-2024/"><u>[New] Eluding Digital Footprints While Enjoying Instagram Stories Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/how-to-add-border-to-instagram-video-3-ways-for-2024/"><u>How to Add Border to Instagram Video?
