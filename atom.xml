If your fans don’t know you’re there, they are never going to follow you.</p><p>To increase your visibility, use the tools you already have in place. If you have a fan base on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network, cross-promote your Instagram page with those people, encouraging them to follow you. Consider paying to boost these posts to ensure even more of your existing fans are driven towards your Instagram account.</p><p>You can also place a link on your website to help visitors find you on Instagram and could consider including a link in your email signatures and other public-facing profiles. When you’re keen to discover how to increase followers on Instagram, maximizing the use of existing resources is a no-brainer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Optimize-your-profile"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your profile"></a>2. Optimize your profile</h3><p>You want your profile to be a powerful piece of marketing, so don’t scrimp on your time investment here either. Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date. Take a look at the profiles of some of your competition to see what’s working for them, then you can make improvements to your own.</p><h3 id="3-Tell-a-consistent-story"><a href="#3-Tell-a-consistent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. Tell a consistent story"></a>3. Tell a consistent story</h3><p>Consistency and regularity are the keys to how to get more followers on IG. Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas. Your visuals should be instantly recognizable at a glance and should present a cohesive narrative across this social channel.</p><h3 id="4-Use-hashtags"><a href="#4-Use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="4. Use hashtags"></a>4. Use hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags are one of the best ways of how to increase followers on IG. Good use of powerful, relevant hashtags will expose your posts to people who are not followers of your page, but who are interested in the kind of content you are producing. When you start using hashtags, achieve success quickly by:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking out the most popular:</strong> Have a look at popular hashtags for your industry. What are your competitors using? What about influencers in your niche?</li><li><strong>Using niche tags:</strong> Getting niche with your tags will grab the attention of a narrower audience, but one which is much more engaged with your business.</li><li><strong>Create your own tag:</strong> Use your own branded hashtag with your posts and promote it with contests and on other channels to get people starting to use it.</li><li><strong>Use enough hashtags:</strong> You can place up to 30 hashtags on any one post but using all 30 every time is probably a little too much. Research shows that between 9 – 11 hashtags tend to be the optimal number, but this will vary by industry.</li><li><strong>Avoid spammy hashtags:</strong> Don’t be tempted into using #like4like or #followback type tags, as although you may find you get more followers, they will be low quality and not really interested in your content.</li></ul><p>Find out more about using hashtags in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use hashtags on Instagram. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post"><a href="#5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post" class="headerlink" title="5. Pick the right time to post"></a>5. Pick the right time to post</h3><p>Posting consistently is one hurdle to overcome; refining the times at which you post is another. An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day. Use a scheduling tool to plan and organize your posts, but also make sure someone is available to respond to comments when the post goes live.</p><p>Check our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >When is The Best Time to Post on Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Guide to know more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

Tag other users</h3><p>Adding a specific user’s tag to your posts will encourage them to share it too, helping to expose your business to more new people. When working on how to get more IG followers, engaging with specific influencers is crucial. However, don’t just go randomly tagging them, as this is unlikely to get the desired response. Engage with them through their own posts, and then use this relationship to help grow your own following.</p><p>You can also get users to tag other users in your posts. Captions such as ‘tag someone who feels like this on a Monday’ or ‘tag the person you’d love to be on this beach with’ will get people tagging their friends like mad. Suddenly you’re exposed to many other Instagram users and have started to build your following even more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Run-a-competition"><a href="#7-Run-a-competition" class="headerlink" title="7. Run a competition"></a>7. Run a competition</h3><p>Contests and competitions are one of the best ways to find out how to get IG followers. There are many ways you can run your contest, from getting people to use a specific hashtag to asking them to comment, like, or follow your account. You don’t need to be a multibillion-dollar business to run a competition successfully, but it does need to be of high enough value to encourage interaction.</p><p>Some ideas for a competition could be:</p><ul><li>Win a fashion voucher by sharing images of the perfect work outfit</li><li>Win a camera for sharing pictures of inspirational locations</li><li>A draw to win an iPad which is entered by liking &#x2F; following your account</li><li>A merchandise goody bag for tagging a friend you’d bring to your restaurant</li></ul><p>Competitions can be great fun, so get creative and think of some exciting offers and engagement opportunities for your specific brand.</p><h3 id="8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video"><a href="#8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video" class="headerlink" title="8. Get to grips with live video"></a>8. Get to grips with live video</h3><p>Livestreaming is huge right now, on all social platforms, and Instagram is no different. It’s the ideal way to share coverage of a conference, a trade show, a training opportunity or to run a Q&amp;A session. You could showcase your factory, do a tour of your offices, cover the opening of your new store… anything really.</p><p>Live streams on Instagram appear at the top of your follower’s feeds, making it an ideal way to engage deeply with those who already follow you. Encourage viewers to tag their friends, perhaps by running a giveaway as part of the video. Users who are online when you start broadcasting will be instantly notified of your live stream, making it a great way to really grab people’s attention.</p><p>You can choose to have your stream disappear as soon as it’s been completed or to have it available in your brand’s story area for 24 hours. Your story also appears at the top of your follower’s feeds, offering you a great opportunity to engage with those who missed the live stream itself.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Go Live On Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Use-Instagram-ads"><a href="#9-Use-Instagram-ads" class="headerlink" title="9.

These allow you to reach out to new followers rapidly, presenting your carefully crafted content to people who may never have heard of you before.</p><p>Using the advertising tools built into Instagram, you can make your ads highly targeted too. Pick who you want to see your ads based on interests and behaviors, demographics, geographic locations, and a swathe of other parameters to help you reach the right people. You are able to advertise in both Instagram feeds and in stories, so explore all your options and test different strategies to see what works best for your business.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Use-Instagram-insights"><a href="#10-Use-Instagram-insights" class="headerlink" title="10.

Use Instagram insights</h3><p>Instagram was the last social network to really get on board with providing data, but thank goodness they do now, and we should all be using it to discover how to gain followers on Instagram. The analytics and insights provided by Instagram are absolute marketing gold dust, so take the time to get to grips with what you can discover to continue to grow your following.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Analytics Tools for Better Tracking Your Metrics &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can view insights for your whole account using the chart button on the top right of your profile page, or for an individual post by navigating to that post and clicking ‘view insights’ in the bottom left. When you visit Insights for your account, you’ll see:</p><ul><li><strong>Impressions:</strong> How many times your ad or content appeared on feeds</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many unique users have seen your posts</li><li><strong>Clicks:</strong> A count of the times people have clicked any link you’ve added to your business profile</li><li><strong>Visits:</strong> How many times your profile page has been looked at</li><li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many followers you’ve acquired or lost in the last week</li></ul><p>The ‘followers’ section will also tell you what times of day your followers are most active, which is highly informative when it comes to planning your posting times. If you choose to view insights for a particular post, you’ll be able to see:</p><ul><li><strong>Likes:</strong> How many like your post generated</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> How many comments were left</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> How many users saved or bookmarked your post</li><li><strong>Actions:</strong> How many actions were taken, such as visiting your profile, following you or clicking a link to your website</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> This metric shows where your post was seen the most, including how many accounts were not following you when they first saw you post</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, when you start drilling down into these metrics and keeping a record of data over a period of time, it’s easy to see patterns beginning to emerge. These patterns will be crucial to tailoring your strategy as you move forward, and to ensure you know how to gain followers on Instagram ongoing.</p><p>So now you know some of the right ways of how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get more followers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on IG. However, there is one way of how to get IG followers which we have not mentioned, and that’s by buying them. We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do. Knuckle down, do things right and you’ll be growing your Instagram fanbase in no time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top"

Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.</p><p>Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.</p><p>Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.</p><p>If you don’t know how to upload pictures and video Instagram posts, check this Ultimate Guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Video Dimensions &amp; Story Size for a perfect post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to drive millions of followers.</p><h2 id="Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor"><a href="#Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor"></a>Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor</h2><p>Besides photos, video content is as popular as picture content on Instagram.

Well, of course you know how to add a ‘#’ to the start of a word to turn it blue, but do you really know how to use hashtags on Instagram to get more engagement on your posts? ?</p><p>Instagram currently boasts in excess of 800 million users, with 500 million of those active on a daily basis. With so many people online at one time, it’s not always easy to get your posts in front of the right people for your business. However, once you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you’ll be able to present your posts to the most engaged users, helping you grow your followers and your business as well.</p><p>Those who already know how to hashtag on Instagram have discovered the benefits this can bring.

Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work"><a href="#1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work" class="headerlink" title="1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?"></a>1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?</h4><p>Before we can start on how to hashtag on Instagram, it’s important that we’re all on the same page in terms of what they are and how they work.</p><p>In a nutshell, an Instagram hashtag is a bookmark; a way of categorizing content. It can be any word, phrase, number or even emoji which is prefixed by the hash symbol (#). Clicking on a hashtag on Instagram will bring up all the posts that have used that hashtag, so that you can discover new content you are interested in.</p><h4 id="2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags"><a href="#2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2.  Why should you use hashtags?"></a>2.  Why should you use hashtags?</h4><p>Whether you’re a startup, new to Instagram or simply haven’t managed to acquire many followers, using hashtags on Instagram is a great way to grow your audience. By finding out how to hashtag on Instagram, your posts can be found by a much larger circle of users.</p><p>As a business, using hashtags on Instagram will help you be discovered by people who don’t already follow your page, helping you acquire new followers and boosting brand recognition. Not only that, but when you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you can increase your reach on other channels too, because when a user shares your content to Twitter or Facebook, the hashtag is shared with it.</p><h4 id="3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.  What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit. However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so. However, they can be great for engagement during a live event, for creating contests and to position your brand deeper in your audience’s mind, so use them where you can.</li></ul><p>Understanding these different types of hashtags will help you understand how to use hashtags on Instagram better, by lacing your post with a variety of suitable tags.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post"><a href="#4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post" class="headerlink" title="4.  How to add a hashtag to your post"></a>4.  How to add a hashtag to your post</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to hashtag on Instagram, here’s a quick walkthrough. You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces. You cannot add hashtags to other people’s posts, only your own, and can use up to 30 tags on any single post.</p><h4 id="5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand"><a href="#5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand" class="headerlink" title="5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand"></a>5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to find the best hashtags for Instagram, there are a few options open to you:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Just doing a simple search can throw up some interesting hashtags and useful data for your post. Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback. These are insanely popular among low quality Instagramers who simply want more followers, without caring about the quality. Stick to carefully chosen, related hashtags to gain valuable followers for your business.</p><h4 id="6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use"><a href="#6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use" class="headerlink" title="6.  How many hashtags should you use?"></a>6.  How many hashtags should you use?</h4><p>No doubt you’ve uncovered a great list of potential hashtags for your Instagram posts, but how many should you use in each posting? Instagram is less strict than Twitter, in that you can use up to 30 hashtags per post. However, that doesn’t mean you should go all out on every post, so how many is enough?</p><p>For some insight into the ‘norm’, you can take a look at influencers and competitors and see how many hashtags they tend to use. You can also conduct a bit of trial and error testing to see how to use hashtags on Instagram to their full effect, by varying the number you use and tracking the results.</p><p>Research conducted last year found that there is certainly a case for the more the merrier. Buffer discovered that engagement was greatest on posts with 11 hashtags, at 79.5 per cent compared to just 29 per cent for one. A separate study by TrackMaven found that nine hashtags performed best.</p><p>As a general rule, there is no rule. Optimum hashtag numbers will depend on your industry, but there’s no need to be stingy as more definitely is more. Remember to test and adapt to the response you are getting to make hashtags work for your brand.</p><h4 id="7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts"><a href="#7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts" class="headerlink" title="7.  How to get onto Top Posts"></a>7.  How to get onto Top Posts</h4><p>Getting bumped up to a Top Post is the holy grail of how to hashtag on Instagram. There are a few things you can do to maximize your chances of getting your post into the spotlight.</p><ul><li><strong>Pick the right hashtags:</strong> If you want to trend for a hashtag, avoid the massive tags unless you already have more than 10k followers. Something like #dietgoals is more likely to steer you towards a top post than something huge like #instafood.</li><li><strong>Punch for maximum engagement:</strong> Focus on getting high levels of engagement as quickly as possible by scheduling your post to go live when your audience is most active. Research your target market, consider time zones and use a scheduling tool to optimize your post if you can’t be online at precisely the right time.</li><li><strong>Add some biggies too:</strong> Using between three and five of the really big hashtags are likely to boost engagement too. You aren’t likely to hit the top post for these, but should acquire a ton of likes and comments, which will help your target hashtag to rank higher too.</li></ul><p>Breaking into the top posts takes some dedication, trial and error and a good level of commitment. It’s all dependent on the Instagram algorithm, the workings of which is a closely guarded secret, but by following these tips you’ll give your post the best chance of success.</p><p>Now you know not only how to hashtag on Instagram, but also why and which ones to use. Why not try reviewing your hashtag strategy and see what results you can get?

Even though it’s a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.</p><p>The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post&#x2F;Reels&#x2F;Feed.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Tap on Manage Option</strong></p><p>The initial step is to select or capture a photo&#x2F;video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the <strong>Manage</strong> option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-filter-manage.jpg"                      alt="ins  filters manage"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters</strong></p><p>For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the <strong>Drag to hide</strong> option to hide the selected filter.

Moreover, the app offers slow-motion, split-screen, and PIP features as well as ten video filters so you can easily overlay two video clips or enhance the colors in a video. You can also record voiceovers, import songs from your music library, or add sound effects to the audio files you use in your projects.</p><h4 id="2-Quik"><a href="#2-Quik" class="headerlink" title="2. Quik"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor" >Quik <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p><p>Besides video files you can also add up to 75 photos to the IGTV videos you create with the Quik app. The app is perfectly optimized for processing the footage captured with GoPro cameras, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use it to edit videos captured with other devices. There are 23 themes with graphics and transitions you can use to quickly create a video and you can customize each theme by adjusting the fonts, graphics, and filters. The app lets you change the aspect ratio quickly, so you just have to select the portrait option, in order to make your video perfectly suited for IGTV. You can see how the YouTubers such as Jake Rich edit videos on iPhone with GoPro Quik from the video above.</p><h4 id="3-Videoshop"><a href="#3-Videoshop" class="headerlink" title="3.

Videoshop lets you merge several clips into a single file, add text to videos, apply a transition between video clips, or even create animated opening titles. Furthermore, you can easily resize a video and create vertically oriented videos for the IGTV platform. You just have to keep in mind that working with a large number of video files can be overwhelming for your phone’s processing power, so it is better to work with fewer video clips if you don’t want the app to crash while you are editing your next IGTV post.</p><h4 id="4-VSCO"><a href="#4-VSCO" class="headerlink" title="4.

The video editing tools are still not available in the free version of the app, and you have to purchase the annual VSCO membership in order to gain access to them. If you decide to become a member of the VSCO community, you will be able to manipulate your footage in virtually any way you want and export it in resolutions that go up to 4K. The rich selection of presets, and visual effects that simulate the visual style of the old film make this digital darkroom an excellent option for IGTV content creators.</p><h4 id="5-Filmora-GO"><a href="#5-Filmora-GO" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can import videos from your camera roll, Instagram or Facebook and use the app’s color correction tools to enhance their colors. In addition, you can combine two clips in a single video to create a PIP effect, crop and rotate videos or add classic transitions between clips. The Filmora GO’s rich library of visual effects and overlays can help you create captivating IGTV videos, while the app’s Text and Titles features allow you to incorporate your marketing messages into the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h4 id="Create-Longer-IGTV-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-Longer-IGTV-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create Longer IGTV Video with Filmora"></a>Create Longer IGTV Video with Filmora</h4><p>If you want to make a long video for the IGTV channel, it would be better to<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >edit it on the computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload it from the computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well.

Fortunately for all of us, turning off notifications is a quick and simple process that can be completed in just a few clicks or taps. IGTV, Instagram’s latest mobile video platform is no exception, and if you decide to use it, you will occasionally stumble upon the content you don’t necessarily like and you will receive notifications about posts that really have nothing to do with your interests. In case you are looking for a way to get rid of IGTV suggestions, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to hide videos you don’t want to see and how to switch off notifications.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Turn-Off-IGTV-Notifications-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Turn-Off-IGTV-Notifications-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Turn Off IGTV Notifications on Instagram"></a>How to Turn Off IGTV Notifications on Instagram</h2><p> Preventing IGTV notifications from bothering you while you are scrolling down your Instagram feed requires a minimum amount of effort. You just have to <strong>launch the Instagram app</strong> and then once the app opens, you should tap on <strong>the profile icon</strong> that is located in the bottom right corner. Upon arriving at your Instagram profile page, you will be able to see <strong>the hamburger icon</strong> in the top right corner. Tapping on the hamburger icon will grant you access to a menu that contains options such as <strong>Your Activity, Nametag or Saved</strong>. At the very bottom of this menu, you’ll spot the <strong>Settings icon</strong>, tap on it and after the <strong>Settings menu opens</strong> tap on the <strong>Notifications icon</strong>.</p><p> Select the <strong>Push Notifications option</strong>, and then scroll all the way down to the <strong>IGTV Video Updates section</strong> of the Push Notifications menu. Tap on the <strong>Off</strong> option, and you’re done, you’ll no longer receive notifications from IGTV. If at any point you change your mind and you decide that you want to receive notifications from IGTV you can return to the Push Notifications menu and select the <strong>From People I Follow</strong> or <strong>From Everyone</strong> option in the IGTV Video Update section of the Push Notifications menu.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Hide-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Hide-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Hide IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Hide IGTV Videos?</h2><p> At the moment this feature is only available on iPhones, while users who access IGTV from Android devices only have the option to report a video they find offensive or don’t like for any other reason. Once you open IGTV on your iPhone, you will be able to see the videos the platform suggests you should watch in <strong>the For You</strong> section. When you come across an IGTV video you no longer want to see, simply <strong>swipe down</strong>, and then <strong>tap on the three-dot icon</strong> that is located next to the Like, Comment and Share buttons.</p><p> A four-option menu will pop up on the screen, so you just have to <strong>tap on the Hide feature</strong>, and the platform will immediately remove the video you no longer want to see and the next video will start playing automatically.</p><p> The process of reporting an IGTV video from an Android device is nearly identical to the process of hiding a video on an iPhone. <strong>The only difference is</strong>, that you should select the <strong>Report option</strong> in the menu that pops up on the screen after you tap on the three dot icon. Using the Hide or Report options will enable IGTV to understand what type of content you like. That’s why you shouldn’t hesitate to use these options every time you see a video that covers a topic you’re not interested in or if you find its content offensive.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Optimizing IGTV in accordance with your interests and tastes doesn’t require much effort, as you can easily hide or report IGTV videos you don’t want to interact with. Moreover, you can get rid of IGTV notifications in case they interrupt you too often while you are browsing through your Instagram feed. Hopefully, this article will help make the experience of using IGTV more enjoyable for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top"

If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts. Don’t eat or drink anything from these people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36245101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/zang_box_trust.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog"><a href="#3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog" class="headerlink" title="3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog"></a>3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently.png"                      alt="way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently"                ></p><p>You’ll lose followers if you bombard them with photographs on a regular basis.

However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem<p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=28010250&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/336__280a.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times.

Because it only works after setup, you won’t be able to see who has unfollowed you in the past.</p><p>Users may see who has unfollowed them, who has followed them, who has followed you but has not followed them back, and who has followed you but has not returned the favor.

If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts.

As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram.

Until recently Instagram was a platform that was mainly dedicated to photos because the duration of the videos you could upload to your account was limited to just sixty seconds. All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload videos that last up to one hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729320&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/2_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV"><a href="#How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="How to Get More Followers on IGTV?"></a>How to Get More Followers on IGTV?</h2><p> Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers"></a>1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

Instagram metrics can be used to better understand what your ideal Instagram follower likes or dislikes, at what times they are most likely to use Instagram or what products they are going to need.</p><p> An insight into the habits of your followers is just one of the things Instagram analytics can provide you with, while measuring the success of your posts or your Instagram strategy, planning campaigns or gaining an advantage over your competition is also on the long list of things Instagram analytics can be utilized for.</p><p> There are two types of metrics you can monitor with analytics tools on Instagram. The account metrics keep track of all your Instagram activities, since the moment you created the Instagram account until the present day, while the Individual metrics shed light on how well your posts on Instagram are performing.</p><p> There are several account metrics, such as top posts, top mentions or top followers that provide you with information that is essential for growth of every Instagram account. Individual post metrics measure Instagram reach percentages and engagement rates, or in other words statistics that help you create better Instagram posts.</p><p> Comparing the data gathered from the account and individual metrics will provide you with a clear picture of how successful your Instagram account really is, and it will point out which areas of your Instagram strategy you can improve.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Best-Analytics-Tools-Every-Successful-Instagrammer-Should-Have"><a href="#7-Best-Analytics-Tools-Every-Successful-Instagrammer-Should-Have" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Analytics Tools Every Successful Instagrammer Should Have"></a>7 Best Analytics Tools Every Successful Instagrammer Should Have</h2><p> Choosing the right analytics tool for the job of monitoring the metrics that are vital for the development of your Instagram account will take you a step closer to your goal.
