    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-Music-Licens-Written-by-John-Doe"><a href="#Navigating-Music-Licens-Written-by-John-Doe" class="headerlink" title="Navigating Music Licens Written by John Doe"></a>Navigating Music Licens Written by John Doe</h2><p>Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users. It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.</p><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short. Instagram’s detection system will limit your content if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h2><p>Under Instagram’s automated detection system and copyright music rules, using copyrighted music is very important to ensure everything is right for your Instagram content.</p><p>In this part, we will focus on using royalty-free music on Instagram. We have prepared three aspects about its usage of it to provide overall guidance for you.</p><h3 id="1-Workarounds-for-Using-Copyrighted-Music-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Workarounds-for-Using-Copyrighted-Music-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(1) Workarounds for Using Copyrighted Music on Instagram"></a>(1) Workarounds for Using Copyrighted Music on Instagram</h3><p>There are several workarounds for using <strong>copyrighted music on Instagram:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:</strong> Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!</li><li><strong>Asking For Permission:</strong> To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.</li><li><strong>Pay For The Copyrighted Music:</strong> You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as <a class="link"   href="https://pixabay.com/" >Pixaby, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://soundcloud.com/" >SoundCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong>Give Credit In Your Caption:</strong> To use copyrighted music on your IG content, give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.</li><li><strong>Post Instagram Reel Videos:</strong> Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song’s details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.</li></ul><h3 id="2-A-Video-Editor-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editor-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(2) A Video Editor To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram"></a>(2) A Video Editor To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram</h3><p>Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram.

To avoid this from happening, you can place an appeal on the platform by following these steps:</p><p>Step1From the notification menu, click the copyright issue message, and you will be provided details of who reported your content and why.</p><p>If the original creator has reported you, their details will be displayed along with the reason.</p><p>Step2Read the notice that says you have permission to share the content in the video and tap the <strong>“I agree”</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-appeal-on-instagram.png"                      alt="making appeal on instagram"                ></p><p>Step3Tap the <strong>“Appeal”</strong> button.

Simply click the “<strong>Music</strong>“ icon while editing your post and find the soundtrack you want to add. This will, however, add a music sticker to your content.</p><p><strong>Can I Use Copyright Music On Instagram Stories?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can use Live or recorded performances and music from the catalog in your IG Stories.</p><p><strong>Can You Play Music On Instagram Live?</strong></p><p>There are some conditions to playing music on your Instagram Live. For instance, you can stream live artists’ performances, play your own music, or add royalty-free soundtracks.</p><p><strong>Can I Use 30 Seconds Of Copyright Music On Instagram?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, there’s no simple rule on Instagram that says using 5, 15, or 30 seconds of a song is always an acceptable use. So using 30 seconds of copyrighted music on Instagram is not considered a safe bet.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed Instagram’s rules about copyrighted music, how the platform detects copyrighted music, and some exceptions in which you don’t have to ask permission to use the music in your posts. We’ve also recommended using the Filmora app to avoid these issues.</p><p>In the end, we answered some common queries and provided a step-by-step guide on what you can do when Instagram blocks your content due to copyright infringement.</p><p>Hopefully, you’ve found this article helpful and can now understand the dos and don’t of Instagram copyright rules.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

Well, we understand your situation. Obviously, if you have to upload your photos or videos one at a time, it may feel quite boring and frustrating, especially when you have dozens of them lined up in the queue. But here’s the good news!</p><h2 id="Introducing-Carousel-3"><a href="#Introducing-Carousel-3" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Carousel"></a>Introducing Carousel</h2><p> Instagram’s update 10.9 for Android and iOS allows its users to upload upto 10 photos and videos in one go. This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone. Tap and hold, on any of the preferred image or video which you wish to upload, until you sense a slight vibration. Now, you have enabled the ‘Select Multiple’, scroll through the gallery and select rest 9 photos or videos that you wish to upload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-2.png"                                     ></p><p> Alternatively, if you have upgraded your Instagram app, you can simply tap the ‘Select Multiple’ option, represented by an icon of ‘stacked squares’, and select up to 10 photos&#x2F;videos.</p><p> Note: Make sure to select the images, in the sequence you want them to occur in your post. A number appears on the top right corner of every image which shows you the sequence in which they will be uploaded. Tap ‘Next’ when you are done selecting the images&#x2F;videos.</p><ul><li>(Optional) The next screen allows you to apply filters and edit your images.

These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</h2><p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow.

From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely.

This is done so that your account can be followed by people who may be interested in your content. If you don’t want to get suggested by Instagram, then here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a web browser and visit Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, look at the top right, where you can see your profile picture. Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section. In this section, you will see a checkbox. You need to uncheck that if you don’t want your name to appear as a suggested user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncheck-similar-account-suggestions.jpg"                      alt=" uncheck the similar account suggestions box"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?"></a>Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</h2><p>Instagram takes note of everything that you do online. From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-3"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-3" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</p><p>If you are an Instagram user, you might have seen something called a suggested post in your feed. These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</h2><p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share. You need to click on the not interesting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-options.jpg"                      alt="click on not interested on suggested posts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That post and user will be removed, and instead of that, you will see a message by Instagram asking for feedback.

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.</p><h4 id="Less-is-More"><a href="#Less-is-More" class="headerlink" title="Less is More"></a>Less is More</h4><p>A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent"><a href="#Be-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-1"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.</p><h4 id="Less-is-More-1"><a href="#Less-is-More-1" class="headerlink" title="Less is More"></a>Less is More</h4><p>A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent-1"><a href="#Be-Consistent-1" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme-1"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme-1" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-2"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva.

For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme-2"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme-2" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

Once you have done that, go through the steps that we have mentioned below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to click on your profile picture with the + sign. Once the camera opens up, click on the Story option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-story.jpg"                      alt="create Instagram Story"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You need to browse through the filters and click on the search option, and then search for Voice Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-voice-effects.jpg"                      alt=" Instagram Story voice effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Voice Effects option. The filter icon will be pink. Please click on that. The Voice Effect filter will be added, and then you can start recording a story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-story-change-voice.jpg"                      alt="change Instagram Story video voice"                ></p><p>Preview your story, and you will see that your voice has been changed to the chosen Voice Effect.

Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.</p><p><strong>Helium:</strong> The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.</p><p>Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!</p><p><strong>Vocalist:</strong> The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.</p><p><strong>Announcer:</strong> The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!</p><p><strong>Robot:</strong> The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Voice-in-Instagram-Reel-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?"></a>Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?</h2><p>Just like you can change your voice when filming a story, you can try the same voice-changing filter while recording a reel.

At the moment, downloading IGTV videos to iPhones is a bit more complicated than saving IGTV to an Android device, because there are no apps on the App Store that enable you to save images and videos from Instagram directly to your phone.

Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform.

All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload videos that last up to one hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get More Followers on IGTV?"></a>How to Get More Followers on IGTV?</h2><p> Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers-3"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers"></a>1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently-3"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media-3"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-3"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-3"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-capturing-instagram-content-on-computers-techniques-and-tools-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capturing Instagram Content on Computers  Techniques and Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterclass-in-visual-updates-igtv-cover-photos/"><u>2024 Approved  Masterclass in Visual Updates  IGTV Cover Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unlock-the-secrets-to-social-media-success-with-igtv-hashtag-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlock the Secrets to Social Media Success with IGTV Hashtag Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/mastering-video-upload-your-guide-to-igtv-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Video Upload  Your Guide to IGTV for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-the-social-sea-identifying-unfollowers-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating the Social Sea  Identifying Unfollowers on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-making-magic-transforming-ordinary-posts-into-social-sensations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Making Magic  Transforming Ordinary Posts Into Social Sensations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-turbocharging-your-instagram-footage-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Turbocharging Your Instagram Footage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-link-it-up-sharing-youtube-on-ig-snapshots/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Link It Up!
